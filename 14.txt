01/07/2020, 12:56 - melchi 🤔: 🤦🏽‍♂️
01/07/2020, 12:56 - melchi 🤔: Thierry has sent at least 10 emails to me this morning
01/07/2020, 12:56 - melchi 🤔: I will just give up
01/07/2020, 12:57 - melchi 🤔: This whole OP20 thing, I can't again
01/07/2020, 12:59 - Lulu: Pele 😂
01/07/2020, 13:01 - melchi 🤔: This whole issue is because we allow Exploration submit Well Plans directly into P1. How did we ever get here. Exploration GM slashed Wells cost by 20M and submitted figures at a level beyond  our control
01/07/2020, 13:01 - melchi 🤔: And with each explanation, Thierry comes up with more issues
01/07/2020, 13:02 - melchi 🤔: They put together this nonsense premise themselves, just cos they want to have work to do next year
01/07/2020, 13:02 - melchi 🤔: Haba
01/07/2020, 13:02 - SHELL@yusuf: What are you explaining? Why 20mln was slashed
01/07/2020, 13:03 - melchi 🤔: They've said its Exploration Management Adjustment
01/07/2020, 13:03 - melchi 🤔: Driven by a 40% savings drive
01/07/2020, 13:04 - Lulu: Let Thierry tell them to go and drill the wells themselves
01/07/2020, 13:04 - melchi 🤔: Project is just not viable but they still want to push it through, hence they slashed cost. Which then shows a false savings of 37% versus OP19
01/07/2020, 13:05 - Lulu: I don’t even know why it’s an issue, a mail to Gogo’s boss simply rejecting the cost
01/07/2020, 13:05 - melchi 🤔: 😠😠😠
01/07/2020, 13:06 - SHELL@yusuf: Why is Thierry not engaging upwards, his team cant solve this now
01/07/2020, 13:06 - melchi 🤔: He should be emailing Dozie, he's emailing me
01/07/2020, 13:07 - melchi 🤔: Maybe I'll just call him, tired of sending emails
01/07/2020, 13:55 - Alfred: lol. Pele Gabby

03/07/2020, 17:37 - melchi 🤔: Some fun shots on Mr. Bezos 👇🏽
03/07/2020, 17:37 - bennie@SHELL: World War 2 in color.
03/07/2020, 17:38 - melchi 🤔: Today, Mike Bezos is the father of the richest man in the world, Jeff Bezos. But in 1962, Mike Bezos came to America from Cuba wearing a jacket his mother had hand-stitched from cleaning rags. He was a teenager traveling by himself and he spoke almost no English.
"When he came here from Cuba at 16, not only was he all alone, but he only spoke Spanish. His grit, determination, and optimism are inspiring," Bezos tweeted about his father Wednesday.


Though Mike Bezos is not Jeff's biological father, he raised him. Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen was born to 17-year-old high school student Jacklyn Gise on Jan. 12, 1964 in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Though his biological parents married, Jeff's biological father did not stay in the picture long. Gise divorced Jorgensen in 1965, and in 1968 married Mike Bezos.
03/07/2020, 17:39 - melchi 🤔: Dr. Oloruntobi inspired 🤪

05/07/2020, 07:26 - melchi 🤔: Please oo, what's going on here? In being charged for doing Shell work? I thought I should be getting internet allowance or working from home allowance
05/07/2020, 07:26 - melchi 🤔: Data is mine, calls are all business calls
05/07/2020, 07:26 - Shell@chuka: 😒😒 ive paid 25k for phone bills with shell
05/07/2020, 07:26 - melchi 🤔: So 🤷🏽‍♂️
05/07/2020, 07:26 - Shell@chuka: Mail Dozie he will give a waiver
05/07/2020, 07:27 - melchi 🤔: So this is automated?
05/07/2020, 07:27 - Shell@chuka: Timothy wanted to launch an investigation into my calls before granting a waiver... I told him to go ahead
05/07/2020, 07:27 - melchi 🤔: Cos no right thinking person will send this
05/07/2020, 07:27 - Shell@chuka: Yup.. you can log on and you’ll see it
05/07/2020, 07:28 - melchi 🤔: Interesting
05/07/2020, 07:28 - Shell@chuka: You have a reasonable boss, waiving it shouldn’t be a problem, or paying it too
05/07/2020, 07:29 - Shell@chuka: It’s some weird stuff where shell wants you to split your calls equally between Skype and your mobile no
05/07/2020, 07:29 - Shell@chuka: 5k
05/07/2020, 07:29 - melchi 🤔: This should be stopped, just doesn't make sense on this working condition

05/07/2020, 07:36 - melchi 🤔: Calls will definitely increase this period. Is Someone hoping to bank savings on this too
05/07/2020, 07:36 - melchi 🤔: 🤦🏽‍♂️
05/07/2020, 07:41 - toba@SHELL: 😂😂😂
05/07/2020, 07:51 - melchi 🤔: Toba, this one you're here. I expect your morning call to be swift and snapping, man has other things to do this morning
05/07/2020, 07:51 - melchi 🤔: If your operations went well, just say 'nothing to report' and move on
05/07/2020, 09:17 - Alfred: 😂😂😂

05/07/2020, 09:45 - melchi 🤔: You will learn from experience
05/07/2020, 09:45 - SHELL@yusuf: This has being a regular for me since Sept last yr min 5k. Yemi always wants long explanations, I just pass now. Conf call Upandan adding contractors yet u want explanation.
05/07/2020, 09:46 - melchi 🤔: Smh
05/07/2020, 09:46 - melchi 🤔: I've emailed Dozie, Osahon, et al to say I'm disappointed, I don't want their waiver
05/07/2020, 09:47 - SHELL@yusuf: The two times I got a waiver is over 5 months not processed, escalated notin
05/07/2020, 09:47 - melchi 🤔: Imagine Lawson in my team, spends a lot of time on official calls, how does he pay back these bills
05/07/2020, 09:48 - SHELL@yusuf: Not on their space, its telecom that handles it
05/07/2020, 09:48 - melchi 🤔: Some of our contract staff are facing a hard time
05/07/2020, 09:48 - melchi 🤔: They should escalate
05/07/2020, 09:48 - bennie@SHELL: The simple solution I see here is to stop using the line
05/07/2020, 09:48 - bennie@SHELL: Your credit is finished and you cannot make calls
05/07/2020, 09:49 - SHELL@yusuf: No need let them keep granting waivers
05/07/2020, 09:49 - bennie@SHELL: Don't know why you are stressing and escalation
05/07/2020, 09:49 - melchi 🤔: Hehehe. Ogor this one na Skype ooo. I don't have a shell phone or line
05/07/2020, 09:49 - bennie@SHELL: Sorry same same
05/07/2020, 09:49 - melchi 🤔: Hahaha
05/07/2020, 09:49 - bennie@SHELL: If it's not Skype to Skype
05/07/2020, 09:49 - bennie@SHELL: I cannot call
05/07/2020, 09:49 - bennie@SHELL: Smh for Una
05/07/2020, 09:50 - bennie@SHELL: I am not adding contractors cos my credit is finished Sir. Please add them from your end
05/07/2020, 09:50 - bennie@SHELL: How hard is that
05/07/2020, 09:51 - melchi 🤔: Hmm, benny
05/07/2020, 09:51 - SHELL@yusuf: Probably best way to solve it. But some cases you cant help
05/07/2020, 09:51 - bennie@SHELL: If you think about this deeply, it's actually what Shell wants you to do
05/07/2020, 09:51 - bennie@SHELL: You can always help o
05/07/2020, 09:51 - bennie@SHELL: Always always
05/07/2020, 09:51 - bennie@SHELL: You should not be using your money to do the business
05/07/2020, 09:52 - bennie@SHELL: Then start chasing bosses to help you approve
05/07/2020, 09:52 - bennie@SHELL: Or grant waiver
05/07/2020, 09:52 - tobi@SHELL: Or better they give you a mobile and extend the credit allowance for it
05/07/2020, 09:53 - bennie@SHELL: Or extend the credit for the Skype
05/07/2020, 09:53 - melchi 🤔: Hmm, are we being bugged? 🤔. #conspiracy
05/07/2020, 09:53 - bennie@SHELL: There's no conspiracy, I will tell even Osagie the same thing
05/07/2020, 09:53 - SHELL@yusuf: For me I felt somehow, he had to ask dogiye why dont u have excess then dogiye complained too
05/07/2020, 09:53 - bennie@SHELL: After sacrifice of your data
05/07/2020, 09:53 - toba@SHELL: Yeah i would expect that for Yusuf....
05/07/2020, 09:54 - bennie@SHELL: On top your data you paid for
05/07/2020, 09:54 - bennie@SHELL: Then you now pay shell back credit
05/07/2020, 09:54 - bennie@SHELL: Smh
05/07/2020, 09:54 - bennie@SHELL: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
05/07/2020, 09:55 - melchi 🤔: See how funny it is
05/07/2020, 09:56 - bennie@SHELL: Apply for an extension and don't use it for business calls or at least use to the limit until it is granted
05/07/2020, 09:57 - melchi 🤔: It is well
05/07/2020, 09:58 - melchi 🤔: In times like this, the company should review the limits that were in place before the WFH
05/07/2020, 09:58 - melchi 🤔: That's what I expect. Things have changed
05/07/2020, 10:00 - melchi 🤔: It's this kind of thing that makes contractors dial into AARs with their mobile phones.
05/07/2020, 10:00 - melchi 🤔: We're just backward
05/07/2020, 10:01 - Alfred: exactly

05/07/2020, 10:12 - Lulu: What rubbish
05/07/2020, 10:17 - Alfred: actually for the skype calls you cannot see the value of your allowance real time. only until it is too late. lol
05/07/2020, 10:18 - Lulu: True, me sef I’m expecting some charges
05/07/2020, 10:19 - Lulu: This WFH has been filled with adding people’s mobiles to the meeting cos of network issues
05/07/2020, 10:19 - Lulu: Anyway Segun has declined adding someone to a call before sha 😁
05/07/2020, 10:20 - Lulu: We were shocked, but in retrospect it’sgood jare
05/07/2020, 10:20 - Lulu: He jejely said he’d exceed his limit for the money, shikena
05/07/2020, 10:21 - Lulu: So really we’d have to kinda use our discretion to gauge when we’re getting to our 5k limits
05/07/2020, 10:22 - Lulu: Yusuf, please stop dashing Shell your money jare, I understand one offs but not consistent dashing. I no do o

12/07/2020, 01:08 - toba@SHELL: This is ridiculous...
12/07/2020, 01:08 - toba@SHELL: Is this how it is done in other OUs?
12/07/2020, 01:09 - bennie@SHELL: Absolutely ridiculous

A certain Learning supervisor must have got Lola upset.

21/07/2020, 12:50 - Shell.judith: Hello everyone, good day. Please I have a question  and I am counting on our over 120years here😁
21/07/2020, 12:50 - Shell.judith: Please, what is the technical feasibility of cutting and retrieving 7in casing from 5000ft
21/07/2020, 12:51 - Shell.judith: Where can I find additional information pls
21/07/2020, 12:52 - Lulu: Depends on the situation, is the annulus cemented or in OH?
21/07/2020, 12:52 - tobi@SHELL: Is it a production csg or liner
21/07/2020, 12:52 - Lulu: If it’s all inside casing, and uncemented then it shouldn’t be a problem
21/07/2020, 12:53 - tobi@SHELL: Exactly... what's behind the csg at that depth
21/07/2020, 12:53 - Lulu: As to offset data within Spdc, I think the max depth we’ve retrieved for 7in is about 2k Fran
21/07/2020, 12:53 - Lulu: *2k ftah
21/07/2020, 12:53 - Shell.judith: It is cemented production casing
21/07/2020, 12:53 - Lulu: And it was an Obigbo well, if I can remember
21/07/2020, 12:54 - tobi@SHELL: Cemented all through... so cement is behind till surface
21/07/2020, 12:54 - Lulu: Hmmm why would you want to retrieve a cemented casing
21/07/2020, 12:54 - Shell.judith: The TOC is unknown but I assume Surface worst case
21/07/2020, 12:55 - Shell.judith: The plan is to sidetrack the well to develop a deeper sand
21/07/2020, 12:55 - Shell.judith: Well reuse
21/07/2020, 12:55 - tobi@SHELL: Are there plans to carry out a USIT/CBL
21/07/2020, 12:55 - Shell.judith: Yes
21/07/2020, 12:55 - tobi@SHELL: Once cement is behind the csg... retrieval becomes complicated
21/07/2020, 12:56 - Shell.judith: You remember the name, pls
21/07/2020, 12:56 - tobi@SHELL: All the 9-5/8" csg we retrieved in alour abandonment was successful... though we had an idea of our TTOC
21/07/2020, 12:56 - Shell.judith: I agree.
21/07/2020, 12:57 - tobi@SHELL: Can u dig deeper into getting info on the vol of cement slurry pumped so u can reduce the variables
21/07/2020, 12:58 - Shell.judith: The well data is sparse. 1971. I have requested for cbl
21/07/2020, 12:59 - Shell.judith: Once i can, I will look for well file
21/07/2020, 13:00 - Shell.judith: Assuming the 7in casing is cemented to surface, what can be done? The casing is most likely cemented in place?
21/07/2020, 13:01 - Shell.judith: Thanks guys for the feedback. I will continue digging for more well information to enable the decision making👍👍👍👍
21/07/2020, 13:01 - Lulu: In this case, in my opinion don’t bother retrieving. Although I doubt it would be cemented to surface
21/07/2020, 13:02 - Shell.judith: I agree. The CBL can tell.
21/07/2020, 13:03 - Lulu: I’m out, plus on leave so that my laptop is parked somewhere
21/07/2020, 13:03 - Shell.judith: 😁😁😁😁😁
21/07/2020, 13:03 - Shell.judith: Thanks
21/07/2020, 13:33 - melchi 🤔: Once the casing you trying to retrieve has cement behind, then retrieval isn't advised. Cos it will affect the integrity of the casing in which it was cemented
21/07/2020, 13:34 - melchi 🤔: Not just the integrity of the casing, but of your Wellhead too
21/07/2020, 13:36 - Shell.judith: Thanks Gabby

04/08/2020, 20:36 - Shell.judith: This is really painful
04/08/2020, 20:37 - Alfred: Nuclear would likely have a mushroom cloud of gas and radioactive particles hanging above it after the explosion. 

This is something that was expended completely. Consumed almost totally during the explosion with no gaseous remnant or side product. I’d suggest large quantities of a very flammable gas.

05/08/2020, 14:37 - melchi 🤔: So initially they sent us this figure so it forms a basis for a Covid 19 contingency  budget for OP20. 

After running numbers and adding stuff up, it had NO effect on the total submission, so yes thanks to the naira valuation 😏,  it was insignificant.

14/08/2020, 09:45 - Kosi: Most likely because of their cost of production and their dominance in the market
14/08/2020, 09:47 - Kosi: Declaring +$6.6b is a good story when you compare with competitors but in absolute terms is still a huge nose dive from Q1 2020 and 2019 equivalent

18/08/2020, 07:01 - melchi 🤔: COVID-19: RIVERS OPENS MARKETS FOR BUSINESS 

*Rumukwurushe (Oil Mill) and Oginiba Slaughter Markets remain closed

*Churches now to operate 50 percent of their hall capacity 

*Local Government Chairmen to enforce COVID-19 compliance in their LGAs

Rivers State Government has announced the re-opening of all markets in the State with effect from Tuesday, August 18, 2020 from 7a.m and close at 6p.m daily.

Governor Nyesom Wike who announced this in a state-wide broadcast today said that Rumukwurushe (Oil Mill) and Oginiba Slaughter Markets still remain closed.

He stated that as the markets resume business, they must operate in strict compliance with the established protocols on wearing of face masks, washing of hands and maintaining social distancing. 

The Governor said government lifted the ban placed on markets to increase the tempo of economic activities in the State.

"Market managers must provide for hand washing and use of sanitizers for everyone at the entrance of every market, ensure wearing of face mask and maintaining social distancing. 

"Any market that opens to the public and fails to comply strictly with these protocols shall be closed down. The market managers shall be prosecuted while the contravening shops shall be forfeited to the State Government without notice.

"Similarly, Churches can now hold services with 50 percent of their hall capacity provided the leadership can enforce wearing of face masks and washing of hands at the entrance by worshippers. 

"The ban on outdoor sports activities at the Port Harcourt Club, Golf Club and the Port Harcourt Polo Club is also lifted. 

"Members of these clubs must also comply with the established COVID-19 protocols or risk another closure. 

"In addition, all night clubs, cinemas, bars and in-service restaurants remain banned until further notice. The established restrictions on public burials and weddings are also still in force.

"All Local Government Chairmen are hereby directed to ensure strict compliance with the protocols in their respective Local Government Areas. 

"We also call on the security agencies to support the State Government to fight against the spread of this disease by enforcing the wearing of face mask in public places and maintenance of physical distancing throughout the state.

"Government has increased the State's capacity for surveillance, contact tracing, testing and treatment of positive cases in line with the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), oil and gas companies that provided PCR laboratories. 

"We are also considering the request for approval and certification by some private laboratories to provide sample collection and testing services," he said.

Governor Wike stated that with the available data on COVID-19 cases, the measures put in place by the State Government are impacting positively on the efforts to control the spread of the virus.

He stated that even though the State presently stands as the fifth most impacted State in the country, there has been a steady drop on the number of new positive cases within the last seven weeks.

According to the Governor, the State can move to a higher level of increased spread if residents do not change their deviant behaviours.

"The deviant behaviour of residents and visitors to the State to comply with the basic COVID-19 rules inspite of repeated appeals from me, NCDC and other well-meaning persons is quite unfortunate. 

"We therefore appeal to all residents to exercise due sense of responsibility by complying with the established protocols on wearing of face mask, use of hand sanitizers and maintaining social distancing," he said.

Governor Wike commended the medical personnel and volunteers who have continued to render selfless services to check the spread of the virus.

He also thanked individual and corporate donors who have supported the state and said their names would be published soon.

On the dissolution of the Taskforce on Illegal Motor Parks and Street Trading, the Governor said the decision was taken because the members took the laws into their hands.

While urging motorists and traders not to go back to their old ways, the Governor announced that a disciplined Taskforce would soon be reconstituted.

Summary, anything bad with ignoring a meeting invite? Must every invite get a response?
31/08/2020, 15:04 - tobi@SHELL: Loooool
31/08/2020, 15:05 - melchi 🤔: 😒
31/08/2020, 15:05 - tobi@SHELL: Kind off.. how is the meeting conveener suppose to plan...
31/08/2020, 15:05 - tobi@SHELL: Especially when you are a key stakeholder
31/08/2020, 15:08 - melchi 🤔: Understandable to respond, Key Stakeholder has to respond.

Say its like errm, Alice sends out HSE meeting invite to Wells staff, must I respond to that? (Notional example by the way)
31/08/2020, 15:08 - melchi 🤔: 🤣
31/08/2020, 15:12 - tobi@SHELL: Loool... workplace etiquettes demand you should though I am guilty too
31/08/2020, 15:19 - toba@SHELL: I am about to send an invite, if you like don't respond
31/08/2020, 15:21 - melchi 🤔: 🤦🏽‍♂️
31/08/2020, 15:22 - melchi 🤔: Funny though i don't expect a response whenever I send invite. Maybe that's why I may be blinded to respond to someone else's.

I accept meetings without sending a response to the organiser. That extra email takes up space
31/08/2020, 15:29 - tobi@SHELL: Me i am a rude child
31/08/2020, 15:29 - tobi@SHELL: I no need ur response too
31/08/2020, 15:31 - melchi 🤔: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
31/08/2020, 16:12 - Alfred: lol. i think it depends on the meeting. but yes, generally it is good to respond all the time. but you do not need to always send the response to the organiser for like wells ops meeting. the organiser will see your response anyway when they open the meeting but you have to respond first

01/09/2020, 16:09 - Lulu: I think it’s cbn pumping dollars into the black market, to increase supply hence a temp drop in price
01/09/2020, 16:09 - Lulu: It’s going for 445 now
01/09/2020, 16:09 - Lulu: I’d wait till tomorrow morning, cos I’m hoping on cheap dollars 🙈
01/09/2020, 16:10 - toba@SHELL: I can give you at 420
01/09/2020, 16:17 - Lulu: For real? No jokes o
01/09/2020, 16:18 - Lulu: Cos I don’t trust you
01/09/2020, 16:21 - Kosi: If you put a clamp on BDCs it will automatically impact the black market
01/09/2020, 16:25 - Lulu: Oh I see, thanks Kosi
01/09/2020, 17:48 - bennie@SHELL: You better not

01/09/2020, 18:16 - Lulu: Ogo why are you pouring sand in my garri
01/09/2020, 18:41 - bennie@SHELL: Just facts o. How many years now, just buy dollars.
01/09/2020, 18:41 - Lulu: I want to buy na, just looking to get at a good deal
01/09/2020, 18:43 - Shell@chuka: What’s a good deal and how much are you trying to buy?
01/09/2020, 18:47 - Lulu: Anything lower than current black market rate, but I’d likely buy first thing tomorrow morning if it’s still at 445
01/09/2020, 18:47 - Lulu: About 2,500
02/09/2020, 07:02 - melchi 🤔: Morning, 

If investing in a fintech startup is something you willing to throw in some money, and hope for it to be the next big thing, there's a convertible note offering round of funding coming up shortly.

It's a Nigerian Fintech startup Ojirehprime. I've kind of been involved in their journey for some time now. In summary, they're building a digital bank, something that isn't mainstream in Nigeria or Africa, but definitely a household system in the West.

If you wouldn't mind getting an invitation email to the Note Offering, just let me know offline, so when the offering opens up, they can send you an official invite for your consideration. 

I can also send you their latest Pitch to see a summary of their journey and milestones so far.

😁

07/09/2020, 17:26 - melchi 🤔: So I was walking by the road, then I stumbled upon a typical stone on the road, then I asked myself if this stone that I almost tripped over is a precious stone, so I wanted to pick up this stone, then my second mind told me..."careful there!, is this stone your own, do not take what does not belong to you". Then , me I was now wondering whats up with my second mind, abi is it not stone again, after all I was on my own, just walking, and I almost tripped. I'm still here by the road side wondering about this stone.

I hope its okay to ask your opinions about this stone. 👀

Some persons here may not mind engaging this stone...🤣🤣🤣. I think I might have been saying nonsense las las sha

26/09/2020, 09:21 - toba@SHELL: RIVERS STATE SCHOOLS TO REOPEN OCTOBER 5

....... Reviews issues concerning COVID-19 Protocols.

The Rivers State Executive Council has approved the reopening of schools in the State with effect from Monday October 5, 2020.

The Council took the decision at an emergency session presided over by the State Governor, Nyesom Ezenwo Wike on Friday, September 25, 2020 at Government House, Port Harcourt.

The Commissioner for Education, Professor Kaniye Ebeku announced this while briefing journalists at the end of the meeting. 

According to him, all Secondary Schools, Vocational Schools, Universities and other Tertiary Institutions are affected by the directive.

He however stated that Council did not approve the reopening of primary schools based on expert medical advice.

Professor Ebeku added that Council also approved the setting up of a Seven-man Taskforce to monitor and enforce the compliance of COVID-19 protocols in the various schools.

The Taskforce, he said, has the Administrator of Greater Port Harcourt, Ambassador Desmond Akawor as Chairman while Mr. Rufus Godwins, Head of the State Civil Service, Commissioner for Health, Professor Princewill Chike, Commissioner for Social Welfare, Mrs. Inime Aguma, Commissioner for Commerce and Industry, Mrs. Ifeyinwa Nwankpa and Commissioner for Information and Communications, Paulinus Nsirim are to serve as members. 

The Commissioner for Education, Professor Kaniye Ebeku is to serve as Secretary.

Also speaking, the Commissioner for Information and Communications, Pastor Paulinus Nsirim also announced the reopening of public places such as parks, cinemas and restaurants that would operate within the hours of 6am to 9pm daily.

Pastor Nsirim stated that night clubs and bars as well as Oil Mill Market and Slaughter Market, Oginigba remain closed.

He said that all the reopened public places must adhere strictly to the COVID-19 protocols or face severe sanctions. 

The Commissioner for Social Welfare, Mrs. Inime Aguma said Government reviewed the compliance of citizens as it relates to Executive Order 16 on the conduct of marriages in the State.

Mrs Aguma stated that henceforth,  applications for marriages must be accompanied with an affidavit stating that there would be no reception.

According to her, a fine of One Hundred Million Naira awaits defaulters of the Extant Regulations.

She added that Local Government Chairmen are to be held responsible if they fail to monitor compliance in their various areas.

The Commissioner for Health, Professor Princewill Chike said that Council also reviewed issues regarding public burials during the COVID-19 period.

According to him, all public burials in the State are to be conducted in line with the Official Gazette of the State which stipulates that not more 50 persons are allowed at such ceremonies. 

Professor Chike stated that henceforth, families applying for burials must provide death certificates and an affidavit that they must adhere strictly with all COVID-19 protocols.

He said defaulters would be liable to a fine of One Hundred Million Naira while Local Government Chairmen are to ensure that the directives are complied with in their various areas.

28/09/2020, 08:17 - melchi 🤔: Hmm
28/09/2020, 08:17 - tobi@SHELL: They dont ve the length we need
28/09/2020, 08:17 - toba@SHELL: Bennie are you thinking what i am thinking🧐😉😉
28/09/2020, 08:18 - tobi@SHELL: We have ordered but we r looking for a short term gap
28/09/2020, 08:19 - melchi 🤔: Understood. This search will now take up the Engineers whole time, he can't focus on the real deal, then Major will come with US performance 😔
28/09/2020, 08:19 - tobi@SHELL: What r u thinking
28/09/2020, 08:20 - tobi@SHELL: Take am easy performance pple... person no fit ask question again..
28/09/2020, 08:20 - melchi 🤔: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
28/09/2020, 08:21 - Alfred: No o.  Come here and see why. Don’t leave it. 😂😂😂

Have you seen the Scin covid combination of controls? Lol. I only saw the cover page. But it has some things for covid. Or just things to absolve the company should you get covid. Lol.
28/09/2020, 08:21 - toba@SHELL: 😂😂
28/09/2020, 08:23 - melchi 🤔: Yea. Sad truth, Its not a bubble after all.
28/09/2020, 08:23 - Alfred: Gabby is there aar for logistics npt? For instance Do you have like findings on or an investigation into why a rig had to pull bha into shoe for 5days ish to wait on ILS to bring mud chemicals?
28/09/2020, 08:23 - melchi 🤔: So your floormen were masks on the rig floor.
28/09/2020, 08:23 - melchi 🤔: ?
28/09/2020, 08:24 - Alfred: Nah. We try to get people to wear it in the accommodation
28/09/2020, 08:24 - toba@SHELL: Gabby see what i was saying...
28/09/2020, 08:24 - melchi 🤔: Yes. Plenty, during the start of Offshore Ops, this was a constant. Logistics and Wells almost came to blows
28/09/2020, 08:25 - melchi 🤔: On a rig with generally bad air. 😪
28/09/2020, 08:28 - Shell@chuka: Tobi what size of elevator are you looking for?
28/09/2020, 08:28 - Shell@chuka: And are you guys okay to source ourside shell Rigs?
28/09/2020, 08:29 - Alfred: This waste is close to millions of dollars. At field level (through the lens of a field staff) nothing is done about it. But when the rig runs drill pipes at a joint per hour less than dwop settings, office will put pressure on the DSV.
28/09/2020, 08:30 - bennie@SHELL: I will ask, but my Toolpushers😪😪😪 not sure if they know where their cross overs are self.
28/09/2020, 08:30 - toba@SHELL: 😂😂😂😂
28/09/2020, 08:30 - Shell@chuka: 🤦🏽
28/09/2020, 08:31 - toba@SHELL: Of lay lay lay, gbas gbos
28/09/2020, 08:32 - melchi 🤔: This is Frigg, the American rig, with American expats 😲
28/09/2020, 08:32 - melchi 🤔: Alfy, nice to know Ogor is the one taking the pressure. Pls be the shoulder he needs during such times
28/09/2020, 08:32 - toba@SHELL: The part i don't like is how Wells will be managing/ trying to cover up NPT caused by logistics..
28/09/2020, 08:34 - bennie@SHELL: We changed to Nigerians😪😪 the story is very long.
28/09/2020, 08:34 - bennie@SHELL: Johnbull is the OIM
28/09/2020, 08:34 - bennie@SHELL: Your former OIM Gabby
28/09/2020, 08:34 - melchi 🤔: So Frigg is a Nigerian rig. Cool 😒
28/09/2020, 08:34 - bennie@SHELL: Not cool
28/09/2020, 08:35 - melchi 🤔: My G. You have to take your words back on his Toolpushers 😡
28/09/2020, 08:35 - bennie@SHELL: 🤣🤣🤣 Ask Alfred that mustered for H2S from his sleep
28/09/2020, 08:35 - tobi@SHELL: Yes of course.. 30ft/350klbs
28/09/2020, 08:36 - melchi 🤔: Shouldn't I be happy. #localcontent
28/09/2020, 08:36 - tobi@SHELL: Looool
28/09/2020, 08:36 - bennie@SHELL: The longest we have is about 20ft, but I asked them to give me the specs from the rig sheet, will share with you.
28/09/2020, 08:36 - tobi@SHELL: Okay.... thanks so much
28/09/2020, 08:37 - Shell@chuka: Make I engage ‘outsiders’
28/09/2020, 08:37 - tobi@SHELL: Na wa oooo
28/09/2020, 08:37 - tobi@SHELL: Correct... Thanks ooo
28/09/2020, 09:09 - SHELL@yusuf: So I have some funding WBS issues and the gist entered how wells waste money🤨. Finance lament upandan and got to how NS was waiting on mud due to poor planning, I just weak. We have suffered, scratch dat we are suffering in the hands of finance
28/09/2020, 09:13 - SHELL@yusuf: We are seen are wasters, I raised PR for diesel, finance responded that I shud go and get the rig current stock before they ll approve it. Another one said why can't I prorate the diesel since Sept is almost over. So I ll tell community supplier to carry  barge and supply 60kltrs of AGO with a barge with 300k capacity. Then in the 1st week of October start the process again.
28/09/2020, 09:18 - melchi 🤔: If i drop the full gist about Finance Wells isn't SPDC eh
28/09/2020, 09:18 - toba@SHELL: Hmmmm
28/09/2020, 09:18 - melchi 🤔: In*
28/09/2020, 09:19 - melchi 🤔: And the kind of words they use in meetings
28/09/2020, 09:19 - Shell@chuka: dial into the movie review on friday...
28/09/2020, 09:20 - bennie@SHELL: So this thing still dey
28/09/2020, 09:20 - melchi 🤔: Summary, they don't know how a Wells Project is executed. Let me not blame them, thinking this is like running a Fuel Service Station
28/09/2020, 09:20 - melchi 🤔: Especially this new crop of guys
28/09/2020, 09:28 - SHELL@majek: Don't blame finance. Blame your Wells leaders for not providing the correct support for you to work
28/09/2020, 09:29 - SHELL@majek: How we have gotten to the point where finance guys will be asking you for justification for technical items, eg quantity of spares you need, should make an average leader go on soul searching
28/09/2020, 09:29 - SHELL@majek: I know we have messed up on some things, but your leaders sha, leave am.
28/09/2020, 09:31 - SHELL@majek: Poor planning is now a buzz word. Like a master key to explain any issue you face running your operations. The only person really held accountable is the well engineer.
28/09/2020, 09:31 - SHELL@majek: When you go and try to paint the picture to your leader, they will call you aside and tell you you dont know how to handle pressure
28/09/2020, 09:34 - melchi 🤔: Finance runs the company, Your Leaders are probably aligning cos they scared of their jobs.

Una never see where Finance dey give my Wells action, in a matter that is entirely ours and not their bizness
28/09/2020, 09:35 - melchi 🤔: Got a mail from Dayo yesterday, I deleted my response twice before finally responding
28/09/2020, 09:35 - SHELL@majek: I have seen this. Its a leadership issue
28/09/2020, 09:35 - melchi 🤔: Dayo wants me to start sending Weekly Operations highlights to him
28/09/2020, 09:35 - melchi 🤔: Bullshit
28/09/2020, 09:35 - melchi 🤔: I nicely told him, thats not gonna happen
28/09/2020, 09:36 - SHELL@majek: Let me not rant here this morning. Bad energy stay far away.
28/09/2020, 09:37 - melchi 🤔: Same here. No need
28/09/2020, 09:42 - Lulu: 😳😳😳😳 and what is your HOD saying

28/09/2020, 14:48 - toba@SHELL: This country is getting too hard for time...time to bail out

30/09/2020, 13:12 - toba@SHELL: See how you are wasting my budget 🧐🤨🤨🤨...
30/09/2020, 13:13 - melchi 🤔: 🙊
30/09/2020, 13:14 - melchi 🤔: No regret. This is like 1 minute NPT on a rigless spread. 🤨

30/09/2020, 15:03 - toba@SHELL: 👍👍
30/09/2020, 16:31 - toba@SHELL: Just a personal thought: is this shift to low carbon energy by Shell not too drastic, very optimistic and a gamble? I know there are ppl with better understanding, but have we not hit it wrong before? E.g Alaska drilling
30/09/2020, 16:47 - melchi 🤔: A 30 year evolution looks normal to me. Target is 2050 init? 🛰️
30/09/2020, 16:49 - bennie@SHELL: Lol is it not 2020? I thought we had vision for 2020?
30/09/2020, 16:52 - melchi 🤔: Did we, don't mic this up with Naija's Vision 2020

30/09/2020, 16:54 - bennie@SHELL: No Nigeria. Shell.
30/09/2020, 16:54 - melchi 🤔: This kind of shift seems to be global, not just Shell.
30/09/2020, 16:54 - melchi 🤔: The industry is going to shift
30/09/2020, 16:54 - melchi 🤔: Yea

30/09/2020, 21:52 - Shell@chuka: The earlier we gaan buy tractor the better
30/09/2020, 21:53 - bennie@SHELL: Contractor claims he has not be paid

01/10/2020, 09:36 - melchi 🤔: Its hard to make sense or draw logical conclusions on mental health issues, in some cases, even when we THINK we KNOW why we're depressed or something, it may not really be that THING,... hard to place a finger on, hard. VP? seems like a dream for most yea, take that away, and you may be taking away someone's escape hatch.  And yet this perspective of mine can be highly flawed. 😔😔

04/10/2020, 16:17 - bennie@SHELL: On Sahara reporters
04/10/2020, 16:17 - toba@SHELL: Hmmmn....
04/10/2020, 16:17 - bennie@SHELL: Who know if napims changed
04/10/2020, 16:17 - bennie@SHELL: Once Kyari was no more

04/10/2020, 16:20 - melchi 🤔: Hehehe. Makes sense why Jude of Napims just told Fred and Wells in the last True Ups, that anything Frigg, we don't know what we're talking about. So Frigg was never discussed, parked till further notice till today
04/10/2020, 16:21 - toba@SHELL: But i tot Shell does contract due diligence and flags up potential issues

08/10/2020, 09:09 - melchi 🤔: Bennie, your rig stopped Chopper landings, but allowed Food supply barges to berth 🤔
08/10/2020, 09:09 - melchi 🤔: Seems you guys are on a long haul brother 😐
08/10/2020, 09:34 - bennie@SHELL: 😒😒😒

08/10/2020, 12:22 - Lulu: Yup
08/10/2020, 13:03 - Shell.judith: Thanks Lulu
08/10/2020, 19:56 - Shell.judith: Hi guys, please, what is the recommended rat hole for cementing? 1ft per 1000ft. Or has it been changed. I see that the shoe track length was updated in 2017 SDPM
08/10/2020, 19:56 - Shell.judith: Thanks
09/10/2020, 09:15 - mayowa1@SHELL: What was it updated to in the SDPM? because I couldn't find a specific length for 7" liner. When planning for cementing jobs, the 1ft per 1000ft was used unless there were hole problems (e.g. cavings) then you'd add a little "insurance".
09/10/2020, 16:55 - melchi 🤔: SPS results. Thierry's biggest drop came from his direct reports 🤔
09/10/2020, 16:55 - melchi 🤔: Issorait
09/10/2020, 16:55 - melchi 🤔: And Yusuf and Co is Operations blessed Joe Mordi. 🤔
09/10/2020, 16:57 - melchi 🤔: Joe sees  +9pt increase over last year in Employee Engagement. Interesting
09/10/2020, 16:58 - Shell@chuka: 😂
09/10/2020, 17:00 - melchi 🤔: Meanwhile, asides Thierry's email, I was going to say the book club is a great tool, Major and Lulu and co, well done. Thats some good stuff you guys have running there.
09/10/2020, 17:03 - Shell@chuka: On a more serious note, it’s funny how the last 3yrs, some managers/TLs that we complain seriously about end up with good SPS scores, warris going on
09/10/2020, 17:09 - toba@SHELL: Well, ppl are getting more and more subtle threats about SPS
09/10/2020, 17:10 - Shell@chuka: Threats?? At y/our big age??
09/10/2020, 17:11 - Lulu: 🤣🤣🤣 I feel he actually tried to improve, so that might be the cause of the +
09/10/2020, 17:11 - Lulu: 👍 thanks Gabby
09/10/2020, 17:11 - Shell@chuka: +9 is a big jump
09/10/2020, 17:12 - Lulu: 😳😳😳 how? Example please 😁
09/10/2020, 17:13 - Lulu: Yea, quite big. Notice the number of people who responded, 70%. Maybe it was more of the people who like him who responded
09/10/2020, 17:13 - Shell@chuka: 😂😂
09/10/2020, 17:13 - Lulu: Guys on the field might not have done the survey
09/10/2020, 17:13 - Shell@chuka: Please who has seen my brother, Alfred Enyekwe?
09/10/2020, 17:15 - melchi 🤔: 😭
09/10/2020, 17:34 - bennie@SHELL: We negotiated his release
09/10/2020, 17:34 - bennie@SHELL: He is still getting over the trauma
09/10/2020, 17:34 - Shell@chuka: 😂😂
09/10/2020, 17:35 - Lulu: 🤣🤣🤣 heyaaa
09/10/2020, 18:26 - toba@SHELL: No comments o
09/10/2020, 18:28 - Shell.judith: At John's town hall when he came to Nigeria,  it was apparent that managers are  rated based on factors that include SPS result
09/10/2020, 18:28 - Shell.judith: So that might be a basis for the veiled insinuations during SPS
09/10/2020, 18:29 - Shell@chuka: I still don’t understand this
09/10/2020, 18:30 - Shell@chuka: You are meant to fill out SPS in the privacy of your personal space... why not just fill out exactly how you feel and let the system do the rest
09/10/2020, 18:31 - bennie@SHELL: Lol I thought the Team lead will get the results of what his team filled?
09/10/2020, 18:31 - bennie@SHELL: Maybe it's Covid that skewed the results. Or maybe people don't have word documents like me to remember what has happened during the year.
09/10/2020, 18:32 - Shell@chuka: 😂😂😂
09/10/2020, 18:33 - toba@SHELL: The same way Nigeria Police put the sign "Bail is free" at the police station 🤨
09/10/2020, 18:34 - Shell@chuka: No now, haba Toba, the era of cement plug is over, the cementers are not even sure of their jobs anymore, no one is sure, live free!
09/10/2020, 18:36 - Shell.judith: Another fear is that of unseen forces on the other side of the border
09/10/2020, 18:36 - Shell@chuka: Lmao... when I hear PR people talking about border
09/10/2020, 18:36 - Shell@chuka: Issokay
09/10/2020, 18:37 - toba@SHELL: True..but that doesn't mean that thierry didn't give the vibes of how SPS is important to him ( probably the only thing he is concerned about😬) and how they started pushing to our faces or reminding us of what has been done to make us happy, and how we should be grateful we still have jobs
09/10/2020, 18:38 - Shell.judith: The matter is subtle
09/10/2020, 18:38 - Shell@chuka: Why should Thierry’s vibe affect you???
09/10/2020, 18:38 - bennie@SHELL: 👆🏿👍🏿👍🏿
09/10/2020, 18:38 - Shell@chuka: This is normal human behavior
09/10/2020, 18:38 - Shell@chuka: Be like Ogo
09/10/2020, 18:38 - Shell@chuka: Ignore all the mails
09/10/2020, 18:39 - Shell@chuka: Bring out your word document
09/10/2020, 18:39 - toba@SHELL: Or how some Tls keep telling us "speak oo, u r free to say ur mind", meanwhile dt is BS...
09/10/2020, 18:39 - Shell@chuka: And type how you feel
09/10/2020, 18:39 - bennie@SHELL: Bro I fill my SPS like ranking o. I arrange all the leaders. I look at their achievements for the year. I try to be fair and just, based on the word document and excel sheet that I compiled for them. Not sure I will be around to do any other type of ranking.
09/10/2020, 18:40 - Shell.judith: The impact of what is typed is actually felt by people who are almost helpless, caught as it were in a web.
09/10/2020, 18:40 - Shell@chuka: This thing is a negotiation sumtin... someone is trying to cajole you, you too put your foot down
09/10/2020, 18:40 - toba@SHELL: Some will 'engage' you and say..." you see now i am engaging you oo", yet they won't approve leave or allowance without scraping ur head
09/10/2020, 18:40 - Shell@chuka: Lmao
09/10/2020, 18:40 - Shell@chuka: 😂😂
09/10/2020, 18:40 - toba@SHELL: The truth is ppl are beating the SPS system now...its a game of numbers
09/10/2020, 18:41 - Lulu: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 Ogo you got me in stitches there
09/10/2020, 18:41 - Shell@chuka: Don’t bother yourself with what others are doing
09/10/2020, 18:41 - Shell.judith: Indeed...
09/10/2020, 18:41 - Shell@chuka: Fill your own exactly how you feel
09/10/2020, 18:41 - bennie@SHELL: <Media omitted>
09/10/2020, 18:41 - toba@SHELL: 😂😂😂
09/10/2020, 18:41 - Lulu: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
09/10/2020, 18:41 - Shell@chuka: Don’t vote apc because the youths on your street are voting APC or campaigning for them
09/10/2020, 18:42 - bennie@SHELL: If this SPS happened during this strike ehn
09/10/2020, 18:42 - bennie@SHELL: Mike Ward for call me
09/10/2020, 18:42 - Shell@chuka: 😂😂😂
09/10/2020, 18:42 - bennie@SHELL: He will be like to bro why so angry
09/10/2020, 18:42 - Lulu: Mehnn I feel my SPS, very objectively, it’s not like they’d see what I filled, so I can’t be bothered
09/10/2020, 18:43 - Shell@chuka: At this stage, we should be bold enough to give f2f feedback..... respectfully
09/10/2020, 18:43 - bennie@SHELL: I believe things are very easy these days. After all we will all chop our strong. Once you book your Strong in January, the rest of the year should be a free ride
09/10/2020, 18:43 - Lulu: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
09/10/2020, 18:44 - toba@SHELL: I gave my feedback the way i felt oo...i was pleased with a lot of things, but i just didn't appreciate the "pushes"
09/10/2020, 18:45 - Lulu: Hmmmm yea if only I’m asked, also depends on the personality of the leadership. I’m not going to kid myself that everything has completely changed and start giving F2F feedback that would hunt me instead
09/10/2020, 18:47 - Lulu: For the pushes, really if we were in their shoes most of us would reiterate SPS so that many people fill it. I agree that sometimes it’s a lot, I guess they sha just have to push. We’d sha fill as we’re led like Ogo
09/10/2020, 18:50 - Shell.judith: If the SPS  outcome is not used to assess performance of (middle) management, perhaps the focus will be different. But then, what is not measured cannot be changed adequated
09/10/2020, 18:53 - Lulu: 👍👍👍
09/10/2020, 18:54 - Shell.judith: I hope we lead with same authenticity we now crave
09/10/2020, 18:55 - Shell.judith: The boundary conditions will almost certainly still be in place then
09/10/2020, 18:55 - Shell.judith: We just have to make decision on how to navigate the hurdles effectively while being authentic,  if we chose to be
09/10/2020, 18:56 - toba@SHELL: Naah.. this isn't about pushing ppl to fill it...i understand that can be challenging,  although it myt pay to ask why ppl are lethargic about filling it( any reasons besides attitudinal issues??)..can't say....but what I pointed out was trying to influence ppl in a certain direction, with comments, "showing off", reverse psychology, subtle threats...etc...these things were there. 
Again, it didn't affect how i filled, but i still have tonpoint it out...i doubt SPS would last for long sha
09/10/2020, 18:57 - Shell.judith: You know humans can work even the most perfect systems
09/10/2020, 18:58 - Shell.judith: If the business interests underpinning any process is at odds with personal interests,  you can almost be certain that humans will find a wal around
09/10/2020, 18:58 - Shell.judith: Goes back to my comment

14/10/2020, 09:56 - tobi@SHELL: Whats hasn't been able to work is to influence contracting
14/10/2020, 09:56 - tobi@SHELL: Our regulations don't align
14/10/2020, 09:57 - Lulu: Ok, so what’s the current JD of a Wells Front end engineer in SNEPCo

14/10/2020, 11:16 - melchi 🤔: What is the response
14/10/2020, 13:49 - melchi 🤔: I have asked a very important question on menti.com code: 1893955

Please vote up that question
14/10/2020, 13:49 - melchi 🤔: Be a brothers keeper. Lol
14/10/2020, 13:49 - melchi 🤔: I've forgotten I'm in charge of the menti
14/10/2020, 13:49 - melchi 🤔: 😁
14/10/2020, 14:13 - melchi 🤔: Una question don do ooo
14/10/2020, 14:13 - melchi 🤔: I will close the menti
14/10/2020, 14:13 - melchi 🤔: Before the system crash
14/10/2020, 14:14 - melchi 🤔: 😂
14/10/2020, 14:29 - Lulu: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
14/10/2020, 16:55 - melchi 🤔: Please I have a question, sorry its about the SPS survey. Thierry asked me to get feelers from the streets on one particular dimension- Total Rewards and Benefits
14/10/2020, 16:56 - Shell@chuka: Don’t annoy me with your question, but go ahead
14/10/2020, 16:57 - Lulu: Abeg Abeg, not even Thierry can make a difference in this respect
14/10/2020, 16:57 - Lulu: So he should just dey where he dey
14/10/2020, 16:57 - melchi 🤔: Lol
14/10/2020, 16:57 - Lulu: Shellis not bothered about Rewards & Benefits
14/10/2020, 16:58 - melchi 🤔: Relax first, the numbers not 'making sense' so he wants to understand why there's positive news in that space. Let me explain
14/10/2020, 16:58 - Shell@chuka: Because we told the LT what to recommend to SCIN LT last year, we said engage the banks (UBA & FBN) to make PTA available to shell staff... they don’t need to reinvent the wheel, total and chevron already do something similar
14/10/2020, 16:59 - melchi 🤔: Though the score on Total Rewards and Benefits was the lowest when ranked with other key indicators, there was still a 12% (+7) increase compared to 2019 scores, and he asked me why thats the case. Were ppl promoted? Was salary reviewed upward, etc
14/10/2020, 16:59 - Shell@chuka: Because people lost their jobs globally this year and many people feel happy to still have their jobs
14/10/2020, 16:59 - Shell@chuka: That’s the answer
14/10/2020, 16:59 - melchi 🤔: So question is why did is have the biggest change
14/10/2020, 16:59 - Lulu: That’s the actual answer
14/10/2020, 16:59 - Lulu: Gabby look no further
14/10/2020, 16:59 - melchi 🤔: Noted, make i just add am for my slide
14/10/2020, 17:00 - Shell@chuka: And for the field guys, their isolation money may have contributed
14/10/2020, 17:00 - Shell@chuka: But this is the real answer
14/10/2020, 17:00 - melchi 🤔: Some interesting statistics though shows that entries from CWI were mostly overly positive (+19)
14/10/2020, 17:01 - melchi 🤔: And we have a drop in Delivery Operations
14/10/2020, 17:01 - melchi 🤔: But CWI swallowed that up
14/10/2020, 17:01 - Shell@chuka: 👆🏽
14/10/2020, 17:01 - melchi 🤔: Whats special in CWI
14/10/2020, 17:02 - melchi 🤔: But this doesn't explain the CWI Delivery divide
14/10/2020, 17:02 - melchi 🤔: Or does it?
14/10/2020, 17:03 - melchi 🤔: Oh, sorry, the drops came from SNEPCO
14/10/2020, 17:03 - tobi@SHELL: I hope he knows he should keep that slide to himself and not address us with it. He should accept his winnings. If he talks abt it... next yr will be bloody
14/10/2020, 17:04 - melchi 🤔: and Thierry's direct reports
14/10/2020, 17:04 - melchi 🤔: Lol. Noted, ill advise him accordingly
14/10/2020, 17:04 - melchi 🤔: Next week townhall is SPS Townhall ooo
14/10/2020, 17:13 - melchi 🤔: And Q&A on Reshape
14/10/2020, 17:54 - Chinwe@SHELL: Timothy actually did improve compared to last yr....albeit it was his direct reports that ranked him. Generally, there's been discernible positive changes in CWI space.
14/10/2020, 17:55 - Shell@chuka: Strongly doubt many people will agree with this
14/10/2020, 17:55 - Shell@chuka: Heard a lot of complaint on the lack of visible leadership in CWI
14/10/2020, 17:55 - Shell@chuka: Anyway, you may be right if you compare with last year
14/10/2020, 17:55 - Shell@chuka: Cos last year was bloody 😂
14/10/2020, 17:56 - melchi 🤔: Yea, last year was 😭😭
14/10/2020, 17:56 - Chinwe@SHELL: Yep....last year was bloody
14/10/2020, 17:56 - melchi 🤔: More like he who is down fears no further fal

14/10/2020, 17:57 - Chinwe@SHELL: What I stated was my opinion. Shey virtually everyone (SN) voted???
14/10/2020, 17:57 - melchi 🤔: He saw the largest increase in Team Leadership this year +17 😬
14/10/2020, 17:58 - melchi 🤔: From F9 to TQ
14/10/2020, 17:58 - Chinwe@SHELL: I personally drew some blood last year

16/10/2020, 08:35 - toba@SHELL: That's financial cost, there is mental and physical cost as well oo
16/10/2020, 08:40 - Shell.judith: Wow!!!

16/10/2020, 08:42 - Shell.judith: My dear. Which PIP during well programme writing could have anticipated this. Hmmm. This can easily escalate to human right issues

16/10/2020, 08:43 - bennie@SHELL: We are at 70% over stays
16/10/2020, 08:43 - Shell.judith: I cannot begin to imagine what you guys are seeing.
16/10/2020, 08:43 - Shell.judith: With a great risk of accidents
16/10/2020, 08:43 - Lulu: Wow!!! So sorry Ogo, it can’t be easy at all, can’t even imagine being onboard
16/10/2020, 08:43 - Lulu: Any hopes of a resolution next week?
16/10/2020, 08:44 - bennie@SHELL: Yeah not been easy managing the emotions if the guys. Even OIM wants to abandon ship lol

16/10/2020, 13:19 - SHELL@yusuf: Sorry man and ur teamout there, not a good but i guess u re closer to the end than the beginning. This is just the complexity of business when penny-wise pound- foolish becomes convoluted.
16/10/2020, 13:27 - Lulu: Honestly, penny-wise, pound-foolish

16/10/2020, 16:15 - melchi 🤔: Just a question though, if your caterers on board join the strike as I hear that's being considered, is the plan to go on hunger strike?
16/10/2020, 16:15 - melchi 🤔: How do they want to pull this
16/10/2020, 16:16 - Lulu: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
16/10/2020, 16:16 - Lulu: Mehnn that would be a different story
16/10/2020, 16:16 - Alfred: 😂😂😂
16/10/2020, 16:24 - bennie@SHELL: They are very angry but they won't abandon their duty. It seems their issue has been resolved now.

20/10/2020, 16:30 - toba@SHELL: I saw it ooo
20/10/2020, 16:31 - melchi 🤔: Even  that SPS presentation by Matthias was to be done by him.
20/10/2020, 16:40 - Alfred: 😂😂😂😂
20/10/2020, 19:23 - Lulu: https://www.instagram.com/p/CGkxFdkhHdf/?igshid=1gddfsgsk67hi
20/10/2020, 19:23 - Lulu: This is really scary
20/10/2020, 19:27 - toba@SHELL: This is terrible
20/10/2020, 19:27 - Lulu: So so terrible
20/10/2020, 19:28 - Lulu: <Media omitted>
20/10/2020, 19:42 - bennie@SHELL: Nobody should be shocked
20/10/2020, 19:53 - Lulu: Mehnn this is just crazy
20/10/2020, 22:18 - tobi@SHELL: <Media omitted>
20/10/2020, 22:31 - Lulu: Just imagine the heartless idiots, they left the hoodlums in other parts of Lagos and came to shoot peaceful protesters at Lekki toll
20/10/2020, 22:32 - Lulu: Obviously Tinubu’s handwork, while I’m sure the governor sat back like a mumu
20/10/2020, 22:33 - SHELL@majek: Oluchi...its more complicated than this.
20/10/2020, 22:34 - SHELL@majek: This is a very complicated situation. No one who does not have the power to give life has the right to take it. We hope someone is made an example of this
20/10/2020, 22:34 - SHELL@majek: Let's steer the conversation towards de-escalation sha. But it is far far far far more complicated that this
20/10/2020, 22:35 - SHELL@majek: Sanwolu's response to this has been epic. Best in class. There is not much else he could have done
20/10/2020, 22:35 - Lulu: Yea I guess it involves so many powers that be or god fathers, politicians. Still Sanwolu is the governor of the state so everyone would blame him, he’d have to take responsibility for this
20/10/2020, 22:35 - SHELL@majek: Hope you know he does not control the police and the military. He can influence them but cant control them
20/10/2020, 22:36 - SHELL@majek: Let's not join those who blame.
20/10/2020, 22:36 - SHELL@majek: Let's try to understand the issues at a deeper level
20/10/2020, 22:36 - SHELL@majek: So that if and when we get there
20/10/2020, 22:36 - SHELL@majek: We make better decisions that those we are holding accountable today
20/10/2020, 22:37 - Lulu: Definitely I blame the leaders, all inclusive
20/10/2020, 22:37 - bennie@SHELL: Question though lulu
20/10/2020, 22:38 - bennie@SHELL: Are you aware of how many Shiite protesters lost their lives?
20/10/2020, 22:38 - bennie@SHELL: Both in Kaduna and in Abuja?
20/10/2020, 22:38 - Lulu: So I know so many people have died in Nigeria, even in Kaduna, all the many killings and all
20/10/2020, 22:39 - Lulu: I might not know their numbers, but again it’s all part of the reason for these protests, bad governance
20/10/2020, 22:40 - toba@SHELL: Very true
20/10/2020, 22:40 - Lulu: I’m not trying to say this is the worst killing that has happened tonight, this one just hit home more
20/10/2020, 22:41 - bennie@SHELL: That's the point I am trying to make
20/10/2020, 22:41 - Lulu: No matter how complicated it is, it’s just all wrong.
20/10/2020, 22:41 - Chinwe@SHELL: Without mincing words, the leaders are to blame for escalating and complicating issues, abeg!
20/10/2020, 22:41 - Lulu: Yea I thought as much
20/10/2020, 22:42 - Lulu: Exactly
20/10/2020, 22:42 - bennie@SHELL: https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/201615-kaduna-govt-says-347-shiites-killed-by-nigerian-troops-given-secret-mass-burial.html
20/10/2020, 22:42 - bennie@SHELL: Just think how many people really died if official govt figures are this high
20/10/2020, 22:42 - tobi@SHELL: E pass 347 sef
20/10/2020, 22:42 - SHELL@majek: If you were the governor what would you do differentlym
20/10/2020, 22:43 - SHELL@majek: ?
20/10/2020, 22:43 - bennie@SHELL: So that's the thing
20/10/2020, 22:43 - bennie@SHELL: In Nigeria protesters are killed very often
20/10/2020, 22:43 - SHELL@majek: We need to de escalate.
20/10/2020, 22:43 - bennie@SHELL: It's such a shame
20/10/2020, 22:43 - SHELL@majek: It's a very complicated situation. It reminds me of the Arab spring
20/10/2020, 22:43 - bennie@SHELL: That it is normalised
20/10/2020, 22:44 - SHELL@majek: Libya, Syria, Egypt. Those countries have not recovered
20/10/2020, 22:44 - tobi@SHELL: All I knownos Tinubu time is near
20/10/2020, 22:44 - SHELL@majek: All sides need to de escalate
20/10/2020, 22:44 - tobi@SHELL: Is
20/10/2020, 22:44 - tobi@SHELL: Unfortunately sanwaoolu will go down with him
20/10/2020, 22:45 - tobi@SHELL: <Media omitted>
20/10/2020, 22:45 - tobi@SHELL: See deception
20/10/2020, 22:45 - SHELL@majek: Tobi how do you know it is deception?
20/10/2020, 22:45 - tobi@SHELL: I wonder who advised them
20/10/2020, 22:46 - tobi@SHELL: Which one is he saying they have been reports... when there is live video
20/10/2020, 22:46 - Lulu: Papa Tobs please give examples of this de escalation, break the English down small
20/10/2020, 22:46 - tobi@SHELL: So he wants to act like its not army that was at the toll gate
20/10/2020, 22:46 - tobi@SHELL: Why didn't army go to the hot spots in lagos why lekki
20/10/2020, 22:46 - bennie@SHELL: The Governors are really sitting ducks
20/10/2020, 22:46 - Lulu: I can imagine 😭😭😭😭
20/10/2020, 22:47 - bennie@SHELL: The decision to hit that toll gate self fit no pass him table
20/10/2020, 22:47 - SHELL@majek: Aunty Lulu  I no know how else to talk am
20/10/2020, 22:47 - tobi@SHELL: Both sitting and crawling go suffer am
20/10/2020, 22:47 - bennie@SHELL: So today, sit back and reflect, why did you and me not trend a hashtag for them
20/10/2020, 22:47 - tobi@SHELL: 2023 polls we will take our vengeance
20/10/2020, 22:47 - Lulu: Yea I know it was probably beyond him, he’d sha go down with them
20/10/2020, 22:48 - Lulu: Yea, cos it seemed too far away, far away North. So many lives have been lost in this country of ours😭😭😭
20/10/2020, 22:48 - tobi@SHELL: Army didn't go to orile, mushin or Makoko where there was unease
20/10/2020, 22:48 - Lulu: Exactly
20/10/2020, 22:49 - bennie@SHELL: An army that will kill more than 700 people because someone touched a generals chest?
20/10/2020, 22:50 - toba@SHELL: Because that wasn't part of the agenda...
20/10/2020, 22:50 - tobi@SHELL: Na now u land
20/10/2020, 22:50 - bennie@SHELL: We know why they hit that toll gate
20/10/2020, 22:50 - bennie@SHELL: It was for shock
20/10/2020, 22:50 - bennie@SHELL: And I think they have achieved it
20/10/2020, 22:51 - toba@SHELL: Personally, i believe Tinubu had a hand in pushing the endsars protest...and i think the other camp is striking back...i still think all these events are tied to 2023
20/10/2020, 22:51 - tobi@SHELL: After curfew we are going to bourdillon
20/10/2020, 22:52 - tobi@SHELL: To continue
20/10/2020, 22:53 - Lulu: I doubt they have achieved it, they might have worsened it
20/10/2020, 22:53 - bennie@SHELL: 2023? You don't see how this can degenerate into a serious crisis.
20/10/2020, 22:53 - Lulu: Cos lekki-ikoyi toll was set on fire after the incident
20/10/2020, 22:53 - toba@SHELL: It has already
20/10/2020, 22:53 - Chinwe@SHELL: Exactly, it would be counterproductive.
20/10/2020, 22:54 - Lulu: I’m honestly scared, it really might degenerate into a major crisis
20/10/2020, 22:54 - Lulu: <Media omitted>
20/10/2020, 22:54 - melchi 🤔: 💯
20/10/2020, 22:55 - toba@SHELL: Lagos is expendable...you saw the prison escape in Benin...did they send soldiers? Only Lagos and abuja....
20/10/2020, 22:55 - melchi 🤔: Another 💯
20/10/2020, 22:56 - bennie@SHELL: In the end sha let these lives not be lost in vein
20/10/2020, 22:56 - melchi 🤔: Shit can go south quickly
20/10/2020, 22:56 - Lulu: Exactly, I hope so too
20/10/2020, 22:57 - toba@SHELL: True
20/10/2020, 22:58 - SHELL@majek: De-escalate. Arab spring didnt end well for most countries.
20/10/2020, 22:58 - Lulu: I guess this is where Ayo’s de-escalating comes in
20/10/2020, 22:58 - Lulu: Ayo it’s not us you need to tell o
20/10/2020, 22:58 - Lulu: It’s the people out there now on the streets
20/10/2020, 22:58 - Lulu: I hear they are already burning cars at Oriental hotel
20/10/2020, 22:59 - SHELL@majek: State of emergency loading
20/10/2020, 22:59 - Shell@chuka: You are talking to people that have money in and visas on their passport
20/10/2020, 22:59 - Shell@chuka: E go still happen
20/10/2020, 22:59 - Shell@chuka: It’s sad
20/10/2020, 22:59 - melchi 🤔: Some people in office can comfortably allow the country to burn without batting an eyelid, thats the kind of Leaders we have.
20/10/2020, 22:59 - Shell@chuka: Really sad
20/10/2020, 22:59 - bennie@SHELL: Vain*
20/10/2020, 22:59 - Shell@chuka: Sad that life will return to normal as always
20/10/2020, 22:59 - Shell@chuka: Chicken change to them
20/10/2020, 22:59 - Lulu: My visa has expired 😭😭😭 but heard flights were already RE-routing sef
20/10/2020, 23:00 - Lulu: Except some of us here have private jets 😁
20/10/2020, 23:00 - Lulu: I really hope it doesn’t
20/10/2020, 23:01 - melchi 🤔: The days of Coups are gone.
20/10/2020, 23:01 - Shell@chuka: It will
20/10/2020, 23:01 - Shell@chuka: Just like it did after all the violence in the north
20/10/2020, 23:01 - Shell@chuka: The niger delta issues
20/10/2020, 23:01 - Shell@chuka: And now here
20/10/2020, 23:01 - Shell@chuka: It always does
20/10/2020, 23:02 - Lulu: Now you’re sounding like my husband, anyway I believed this is different
20/10/2020, 23:03 - melchi 🤔: Synonymous with protests in black Africa
20/10/2020, 23:03 - SHELL@majek: You cant change a system with these short duration events
20/10/2020, 23:03 - SHELL@majek: The country has been on a trajectory for more than 60yrs
20/10/2020, 23:04 - SHELL@majek: No be 1month protest go change am. The protest is necessary to kick start it
20/10/2020, 23:04 - SHELL@majek: But the protest itself wont change it
20/10/2020, 23:04 - SHELL@majek: So. Agreed
20/10/2020, 23:04 - Lulu: True, I agree, I believe it would kick start the change required
20/10/2020, 23:05 - bennie@SHELL: Kick start what? In Nigeria. I have a waterfront in Daura to sell for you.
20/10/2020, 23:05 - SHELL@majek: The problems are also not "out there". The problems are within us. If you clear out all the leaders 99% of who you will replace them with will do same. Not better.
20/10/2020, 23:05 - Shell@chuka: Don’t kill me
20/10/2020, 23:06 - Shell@chuka: Bros systems should be stronger than individuals
20/10/2020, 23:06 - bennie@SHELL: Guys, nothing will change
20/10/2020, 23:06 - SHELL@majek: So make we see where the real problem dey. For me, nir be Tinubu
20/10/2020, 23:06 - SHELL@majek: The curse of 3rd world countries brov. That's our curse. It's the other way round
20/10/2020, 23:06 - Shell@chuka: The hope is to build strong systems not to put a saint in power
20/10/2020, 23:06 - SHELL@majek: You need people to make systems na
20/10/2020, 23:07 - Shell@chuka: I’m taking a break guys
20/10/2020, 23:07 - SHELL@majek: Na the people go still make or break the system
20/10/2020, 23:07 - Shell@chuka: Stay safe
20/10/2020, 23:07 - Shell@chuka: 💪🏾
20/10/2020, 23:07 - SHELL@majek: The enemy isnt out there. Ehem
20/10/2020, 23:07 - SHELL@majek: Me too I am following Major💪🏾👆🏾💪🏾
20/10/2020, 23:07 - melchi 🤔: I actually don't know what to say, every angle is a mess
20/10/2020, 23:09 - SHELL@majek: That's why I said it's very complicated. So we should avoid single angles
20/10/2020, 23:10 - melchi 🤔: <Media omitted>
20/10/2020, 23:10 - melchi 🤔: Maybe be fake news. Take note
20/10/2020, 23:11 - SHELL@majek: If it may be fake news why share it?
20/10/2020, 23:11 - bennie@SHELL: When DSS come find you
20/10/2020, 23:11 - bennie@SHELL: We go trend #Freegabby
20/10/2020, 23:12 - melchi 🤔: This isnt funny though
20/10/2020, 23:15 - toba@SHELL: Fake news
21/10/2020, 01:33 - Shell@chuka: Can you add your signature? ✍️
http://chng.it/jcDV4x7V
21/10/2020, 05:55 - melchi 🤔: 👍🏽
21/10/2020, 06:20 - Shell@chuka: You guys should run commentary for today’s townhall
21/10/2020, 06:33 - melchi 🤔: Still got bad taste in my mouth though. Not even looking forward to the meeting 😒
21/10/2020, 09:23 - melchi 🤔: Major, nothing interesting out there. Sober moments for the nation, then irrelevant information on operations from Joe. 

We could have all easily done without that SPS presentation from Matthias. Waste of time.

COVID updates, still not necessary, waste of time in my opinion. Keep wearing your masks.

Questions on Reshape, let me paraphrase Matt, "Questions are still being collated. After collation, the ones we have answers to, we will answer, the ones we don't have answers to, we will say so" 👀. Me i sha know I've stopped collating. Now wondering if it was a waste of my time.
21/10/2020, 09:37 - Lulu: Yea no one was in the mood, very sober moment for us all
21/10/2020, 09:39 - Lulu: For Reshape, Thierry or Matthias can’t answer those questions, they don’t have the answers. Maybe till early next year
21/10/2020, 09:40 - melchi 🤔: We don't need answers again sef. Doctored answers?

Try suggesting this to Dozie: lets put a hold on Townhall's for a while.
21/10/2020, 10:04 - Chinwe@SHELL: Lulu, well done for briefly refocusing our attention.👍
21/10/2020, 10:27 - toba@SHELL: <Media omitted>
21/10/2020, 10:27 - toba@SHELL: <Media omitted>
21/10/2020, 10:33 - Lulu: 😁🤗
21/10/2020, 10:34 - Lulu: 😳😳😳 what’s happening here
21/10/2020, 10:34 - toba@SHELL: Thats Yaba this morning
21/10/2020, 10:36 - Lulu: Wow
21/10/2020, 10:36 - Lulu: I’m watching Channels, Sanwo Olu is giving his speech
21/10/2020, 11:05 - melchi 🤔: Pls what channel is Channels. Cant find it on Dstv
21/10/2020, 11:05 - melchi 🤔: Abi is it just me
21/10/2020, 11:05 - melchi 🤔: Gunshots and disturbance in Oyigbo by the way
21/10/2020, 11:07 - Lulu: 420
21/10/2020, 11:07 - Lulu: Hmmm, let’s all sha stay safe and stock up
21/10/2020, 12:37 - Lola@shell: Exactly
21/10/2020, 12:40 - Lola@shell: The difference is they have always been isolated. This protest has united Nigerians in a way that is unprecedented. Asides from Occupy Nigeria
21/10/2020, 12:41 - bennie@SHELL: United Lagosians, maybe. The North? I doubt
21/10/2020, 12:42 - Lola@shell: People are protesting in Plateau, Kaduna, Kano, Abuja, Delta, Rivers, Edo, Osun, Ekiti, Oyo, etc all for the same cause
21/10/2020, 12:43 - Lola@shell: I'm hopeful that it'll make a difference
21/10/2020, 12:43 - bennie@SHELL: 👍🏿👍🏿
21/10/2020, 12:44 - toba@SHELL: You are scared because you were a science student and a scientist. Those with humanistic learning know that the 'revolution' will miscarry, revolutionaries will turn on themselves when dividing the spoils of success, anarchists will take over and authorities will crack down. Almost all revolutions in history except the  American revolution against an external british colonialist failed.  French revolution failed.  Albert Camus,  his book, The Rebel is a good read !
21/10/2020, 12:45 - melchi 🤔: Focus on Africa
21/10/2020, 12:45 - melchi 🤔: All these white models won't fit here
21/10/2020, 12:47 - toba@SHELL: So tell me which one has worked in africa?
21/10/2020, 12:48 - bennie@SHELL: Revolutions are nonsense
21/10/2020, 12:50 - melchi 🤔: Whats going on now is not a revolution. That's my point,  I'm not saying A revolution will or will not work
21/10/2020, 12:55 - toba@SHELL: Okay
21/10/2020, 12:57 - melchi 🤔: I'm happy someone is hopeful. I'm hopeless
21/10/2020, 13:02 - Lulu: Gabby you’re needed at the cadence
21/10/2020, 13:02 - Lulu: 😁
21/10/2020, 13:03 - Lulu: Where’s your man Fred?
21/10/2020, 13:03 - melchi 🤔: I don tell Fred say my mind no dey here
21/10/2020, 13:04 - melchi 🤔: Plus Dozie has given the team time off
21/10/2020, 13:04 - Lulu: Pele, I feel you.
21/10/2020, 13:08 - Lola@shell: Unlike the french revolution the Nigerian protests have no leader. They're not anyone's pawn
21/10/2020, 13:08 - tobi@SHELL: Core north is pro sars
21/10/2020, 13:08 - Lola@shell: Also the french revolution achieved part of it's purpose so it wasn't a complete failure
21/10/2020, 13:09 - Lola@shell: True
21/10/2020, 13:10 - toba@SHELL: So what has been successful so far in nigeria?
21/10/2020, 13:10 - Lola@shell: It's sad that even the police who will benefit from some of these reforms are against it
21/10/2020, 13:10 - Lola@shell: Nothing
21/10/2020, 13:10 - Lola@shell: But it just started
21/10/2020, 13:11 - Lola@shell: If it were that easy we wouldn't need to protest in the first place
21/10/2020, 13:11 - Lola@shell: Some people have fed fat on the land for 60 years
21/10/2020, 13:11 - Lola@shell: They won't let go easily
21/10/2020, 13:12 - Lola@shell: We may or may not succeed
21/10/2020, 13:12 - Lola@shell: But it is important that we try
21/10/2020, 13:12 - Lulu: I agree, we just have to try
21/10/2020, 13:12 - Lola@shell: Not trying hasn't helped anyone
21/10/2020, 13:13 - toba@SHELL: You need to leave social media and check realities...in many parts of Nigeria, the protests didnt reach the rural areas....just some cities
21/10/2020, 13:13 - Lola@shell: All the revolutions we claim failed eventually succeeded. It wasn't immediate but they set the balm rolling
21/10/2020, 13:13 - Lola@shell: Ball*
21/10/2020, 13:14 - Lola@shell: If you have a better option for achieving change in Nigeriaplease let us know
21/10/2020, 13:14 - toba@SHELL: No...goan check ur history well and check wat the revolution initially sought to achieve
21/10/2020, 13:14 - Lola@shell: This country as it is is unbearable for a lot of people
21/10/2020, 13:16 - Lola@shell: There were revolutions to abolish slavery, allow black people have basic human rights, remove the monarchy in some countries, reduce some taxes, etc
21/10/2020, 13:16 - Lola@shell: All those things ended up being achieved one way or the other
21/10/2020, 13:16 - Lola@shell: Even if not directly from the revolutions
21/10/2020, 13:17 - toba@SHELL: But not by the revolution...dts d point
21/10/2020, 13:17 - Lola@shell: Keeping quiet is not the solution
21/10/2020, 13:17 - Lola@shell: The revolutions set the ball rolling for change
21/10/2020, 13:18 - Lola@shell: They were an acknowledgement of the existence of a problem
21/10/2020, 13:30 - Lulu: Toba please guide on on a better solution at this point 😝 I believe Revolutions play their part in change, like Lola has said, might not be immediate but would most likely birth more solutions
21/10/2020, 13:35 - toba@SHELL: See me in camera, come with offering
21/10/2020, 13:35 - Lulu: 😝 I’m weak jare
21/10/2020, 13:35 - Lulu: I’d close early today, I can’t shout
21/10/2020, 13:37 - toba@SHELL: Let me give you an example...certain demands by the endsars protest were met...e.g. scrapping, plans to pay victims, judicial panels...that should have been accepted....then regroup and wait for another opportunity and make other demands
21/10/2020, 13:38 - toba@SHELL: Like lola said before thats how certain slavery, black oppression was abolished....
21/10/2020, 13:39 - toba@SHELL: It is like project mgt...another opportunity,  you can do end NASS
21/10/2020, 13:39 - Lulu: While the police brutality continued, didn’t stop at all
21/10/2020, 13:40 - toba@SHELL: But some ppl got carried away by the little success and allowed anarchists hijack it
21/10/2020, 13:40 - toba@SHELL: Have you seen Lagos now? Buildings on fire, courts, banks, port authority..is that how we want the change to happen?
21/10/2020, 13:42 - toba@SHELL: The anarchists are not on twitter, they don't do social media...just 500 naira and dry gin...and it is go
21/10/2020, 13:42 - toba@SHELL: Like ayo said, we need to de escalate, those that can pray for peace, pray...and then wait for chance to regroup
21/10/2020, 13:43 - toba@SHELL: Before ppl add tribalism and religion to fuel fire...
21/10/2020, 13:44 - toba@SHELL: Ppl are under estimating the situation right now...they burn Obas palace, some illiterate person would say 'ah its igbos' before you know it...gbam...
21/10/2020, 13:47 - Shell@chuka: Take everything you see on SM as half truth, as usual old vids will begin to circulate
21/10/2020, 13:48 - Lulu: I agree with de-escalating, unfortunately the people on the streets with the dry gin and all are not on social media
21/10/2020, 13:48 - Lulu: Yeaa
21/10/2020, 14:00 - tobi@SHELL: Arise just confirmed it..  and its not igbos but his subjects
21/10/2020, 14:01 - toba@SHELL: I didn't say igbos o!
21/10/2020, 14:02 - tobi@SHELL: I know
21/10/2020, 14:06 - Lulu: 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Toba don fear
21/10/2020, 14:48 - melchi 🤔: Here's a viewpoint from a friend of mine. Some sense in here
21/10/2020, 14:48 - melchi 🤔: From an experiential point of view, I agree with the #EndSARS and #EndPoliceBrutality sentiment…it’s a valid protest.

In my undergrad days over a decade ago, I was arrested by men of SARS on the morning of my 22nd birthday while on my way back from dropping my girl-friend (now wife) at the bus park for her trip to Lagos. It’s 6:30am in the morning and my offence was that I was driving a car as a young man and more so, a student. They labeled me a fraudster and took me to the police state HQ where I saw other innocent people like me being tortured and made to admit to crimes they didn’t commit (story for another day). So i know in an intricate way, the pains of fellow Nigerians.

The shocking national spread, traction and effectiveness of the protests took the Government by surprise as they are used to lethargic attitudinal indifference with which Nigerians greet Government impunity. That in itself is a win. The initial 5-point demands of the protest got a nod from the government (well, we can debate the sincerity of it later). This also, is a win or partial win depending on what side of the argument you fall.

Interestingly, the streak of victories has started to fuel rising appetite for more demands from protesters to the point where the removal of Buhari is being contemplated in some quarters. Now, this is where I feel poo-poo will hit the fan.

Think about it…You seriously want to depose a legal and democratically elected President who happens to be an Ex-General, who happens to be a Muslim, who happens to be from the Fulani contraption, who happens to be from the core North, and who epitomizes the fading generation of bad Nigerian leaders with blood on their hands, who are tone deaf and not answerable to the citizenry? This is an invitation for Bloodshed…refrain from it guys.

Already, things are going bad. Some (few) genuinely angry youth protesters vandalizing things as well as sponsored thugs doing violence are already marring the peaceful protests. Police were attacked yesterday in Yaba Lagos. Majority of Northerners are starting to see it as a political play to sabotage the full 8-years tenor of Northern presidency. The Christian prayer movement backing the protest is being seen as a religious conspiracy to flush out a Muslim president. There seems to be a convolution of war and national crisis elements coming together.

My counsel...De-escalation.

Take the win…take the partial win. Convert the momentum to what the youth generation can build on for sustainable change both by ballot and by protests when another need for it arises.

I hope my analysis is wrong. I hope I am absolutely wrong but I just don’t feel good about how this is playing out.

De-escalate!!!

22/10/2020, 08:48 - tobi@SHELL: This is so annoying
22/10/2020, 09:05 - melchi 🤔: 😔
22/10/2020, 09:27 - Lulu: This is just sad and annoying, unfortunately I can’t say it won’t happen again. These malls have really had it hard. I remember last year’s vandalism too at the mall at Sangotedo area. Just terrible
22/10/2020, 09:27 - Lulu: So many banks, business outlets have been vandalized
22/10/2020, 09:34 - Lulu: Sanwo olu is live on Arise news
22/10/2020, 09:35 - tobi@SHELL: <Media omitted>
22/10/2020, 09:36 - tobi@SHELL: <Media omitted>
22/10/2020, 09:44 - Lulu: Exactly, the smaller shops would suffer it, except they already had insurance. Really the malls would need to get proper armed security for such periods, inshort they should have done that since last week sef as the protests began
22/10/2020, 09:44 - Lulu: I know the rental cost for these shops are sooo high
22/10/2020, 09:53 - tobi@SHELL: If service charge is 10mln for a shop of 108sq m... so how much is rent
22/10/2020, 10:06 - tobi@SHELL: In asaba mall, rent is 50dollars/sq meter monthly for rent
22/10/2020, 10:10 - Lulu: 😳😳😳 I wonder if these businesses break even, ie the smaller ones
22/10/2020, 10:11 - tobi@SHELL: Story for another day... there is a lot of money laudering
22/10/2020, 10:13 - Shell.judith: My thoughts exactly
22/10/2020, 10:14 - Shell.judith: Some of those shops are fronts cleaning
22/10/2020, 10:17 - Lulu: Yea most likely
22/10/2020, 11:05 - melchi 🤔: Whats uncle Tola's full name 🤔
22/10/2020, 11:05 - melchi 🤔: 😬
22/10/2020, 11:05 - toba@SHELL: Dedenuola
22/10/2020, 11:05 - melchi 🤔: Ahaaa. Thats it
22/10/2020, 11:06 - melchi 🤔: My brain froze for a bit
22/10/2020, 11:11 - tobi@SHELL: <Media omitted>
22/10/2020, 11:19 - melchi 🤔: Toba, shey you can see, shey you dey see am
22/10/2020, 11:19 - tobi@SHELL: Where the security operatives
22/10/2020, 11:19 - tobi@SHELL: This raid was over 24hrs
22/10/2020, 11:20 - melchi 🤔: Unfortunate
22/10/2020, 11:24 - toba@SHELL: See what? Don't call my name o...go to twitter and look for the people to call
22/10/2020, 11:26 - toba@SHELL: How do you expect security operatives? If police goes there, they will kill them..if police shoot back, ppl will share videos of police shooting ppl...truth is anything goes once anarchists are let loose
22/10/2020, 11:28 - Lulu: My goodness!!!😭😭😭😭😭
22/10/2020, 11:30 - tobi@SHELL: These ones are hoodlums
22/10/2020, 11:30 - tobi@SHELL: They should shoot them... not people singing at toll gate
22/10/2020, 11:30 - toba@SHELL: Yes i know...
22/10/2020, 11:31 - toba@SHELL: Oh but when pppl share videos online,,,they dont tag them hoodlums...they say it is pple
22/10/2020, 11:32 - toba@SHELL: For me, they should declare state of emergency sef in lagos if this continues today...hoodlums r already breaking into normal houses
22/10/2020, 11:35 - tobi@SHELL: You tell pple to obey curfew for hoodlums to be stealing their livelihood
22/10/2020, 11:36 - tobi@SHELL: Let them allow everybody come out and defend their businesses abeg
22/10/2020, 11:38 - Lulu: They really need to declare state of emergency, if this is not stopped, the hoodlums would break into estates and houses
22/10/2020, 11:52 - tobi@SHELL: <Media omitted>
22/10/2020, 12:33 - Lulu: What’s happening, an early pay for us? Cos I just saw alert
22/10/2020, 12:35 - Lola@shell: Exactly Tobi. Very good point. People pay huge amounts of money to rent stalls in these malls and there's no security
22/10/2020, 12:35 - Lola@shell: It's pointless
22/10/2020, 12:36 - tobi@SHELL: <Media omitted>
22/10/2020, 12:36 - Lola@shell: Even civilized societies where this kind of vandalism is less likely to happen have overnight security in their malls
22/10/2020, 12:36 - tobi@SHELL: They do but are not armed.. they all took to their heels
22/10/2020, 12:37 - Lola@shell: They must really hate the man
22/10/2020, 12:37 - Lola@shell: Ok
22/10/2020, 12:37 - tobi@SHELL: The E we part offed me
22/10/2020, 12:38 - Lulu: They really must hate him
22/10/2020, 12:38 - Lola@shell: The so-called police are always rearing to go when it's time to shoot helpless protesters but no where to be found where there's actual crime
22/10/2020, 12:38 - Lulu: My goodness! 😳😳😳
22/10/2020, 12:38 - Lulu: What does E we mean?
22/10/2020, 12:38 - Lulu: Exactly, where are the military or police now? No where to be found
22/10/2020, 12:39 - Lola@shell: Sanwoolu could have used these thugs vandalizing malls to redeem himself a bit by putting the police on top if it
22/10/2020, 12:39 - Lulu: Are they saying that the hoodlums are more powerful than they are?
22/10/2020, 12:39 - Lola@shell: It means swim
22/10/2020, 12:39 - tobi@SHELL: <Media omitted>
22/10/2020, 12:39 - tobi@SHELL: Have your bath
22/10/2020, 12:39 - Lulu: Ok thanks
22/10/2020, 12:39 - Lulu: Exactly, it means that he really has no control over his state
22/10/2020, 12:40 - Lulu: Ayo this typing that you’ve been typing😁
22/10/2020, 12:41 - SHELL@majek: I have been wondering whether to reply some comments. 😏
22/10/2020, 12:41 - Lulu: 😁 reply na
22/10/2020, 12:42 - SHELL@majek: Lol. See ehn, the vandalism of these stores is very complicated to prevent. Even if you have armed guards, you wont be able to keep the mob away without shooting. And if you do, you agitate them further. If anyone dies on your ground, the entire mob will come for you. And they will destroy all shoprite assets across the country
22/10/2020, 12:42 - tobi@SHELL: Police wey no get bullet...
22/10/2020, 12:43 - SHELL@majek: Also, security is the govts responsibility. You cant really have enough guards to secure these large malls. Remember these malls would pay taxes, settle communities etc.. it's a bit if a stretch expecting them to provide total GSA cover
22/10/2020, 12:43 - Lulu: I get it, but there surely has to be a way to manage it, this won’t be the first time we’re seeing mobs, the police or military shot be trained on all this
22/10/2020, 12:43 - SHELL@majek: This is civilians turning on civilians now
22/10/2020, 12:43 - Lulu: So if this continues, are we saying that nothing will be done?
22/10/2020, 12:44 - SHELL@majek: For me, the devil, in the case, it the guy staring back in the mirror
22/10/2020, 12:44 - SHELL@majek: Us.
22/10/2020, 12:44 - SHELL@majek: State of emergency loading
22/10/2020, 12:44 - tobi@SHELL: Won't it better for pple to defend their livelihood then.. some pple have selena's at their disposal
22/10/2020, 12:44 - Lulu: Yea, but they’re rents are sooo high, anyway it’s the people who are paying such rents sha. I’m sure these malls would change somethings going forward
22/10/2020, 12:45 - Lulu: They should already
22/10/2020, 12:45 - SHELL@majek: Tobi what you are asking for here is alot more than this
22/10/2020, 12:45 - SHELL@majek: How will you know who is Legit and who is fake?
22/10/2020, 12:46 - tobi@SHELL: The suffering is too much majek
22/10/2020, 12:46 - SHELL@majek: It will totally spiral out of control before you blink
22/10/2020, 12:46 - SHELL@majek: The suffering is plenty o. It is
22/10/2020, 12:46 - Lulu: This method has it’s issues sha
22/10/2020, 12:47 - tobi@SHELL: Cos no form of compensation will be given
22/10/2020, 12:47 - Lulu: It really is. I have some items stuck at two courier companies in Lagos. I’m just hoping their outlets haven’t been affected cos it’s a lot of money. I can’t shout Abeg
22/10/2020, 12:47 - Lulu: This thing affects almost everyone
22/10/2020, 12:47 - Lulu: Inshort everyone
22/10/2020, 12:48 - Lulu: Except Buhari and the likes
22/10/2020, 12:49 - SHELL@majek: 😊
22/10/2020, 12:55 - Lulu: Did you guys listen to Sanwo-Olu’s speech this morning 🤣🤣🤣🤣
22/10/2020, 12:55 - Lulu: His explanation about the light/advert that was switched off hence the darkness 🤣🤣🤣
22/10/2020, 12:56 - Lola@shell: I used to have some respect for him
22/10/2020, 12:56 - Lola@shell: He's made a complete puppet of himself
22/10/2020, 12:56 - Lulu: He really has 🤣🤣🤣 so shameful
22/10/2020, 12:57 - Lola@shell: Plus they should have given up the assumption that the masses are stupid
22/10/2020, 12:57 - Lulu: Seems like they’re still operating in ages past
22/10/2020, 12:58 - Lola@shell: He'd be better off empathising and mouthing platitudes than all the silly lies he's been telling
22/10/2020, 12:58 - Lulu: Exactly, he’s just making things worse
22/10/2020, 13:19 - bennie@SHELL: The Lagos Governor had a stellar performance in all this sha. It's such a pity he is taking the blame for so many things he cannot control.
22/10/2020, 13:22 - toba@SHELL: Totally agree...
22/10/2020, 13:24 - bennie@SHELL: Is there an official death toll now from the gate massacre? I see apologies over the lie that CCtV was cut off. Anyone have a death toll now?
22/10/2020, 13:25 - Alfred: We are going to act like Oluchi did not just mention alert??? Oluchi please confirm alert has started. 😅
22/10/2020, 13:42 - SHELL@majek: Words on marble. He has done very well.
22/10/2020, 13:46 - Shell.judith: I agree. He has carried himself with poise. If our politicians had half his sense of accountability,  perhaps, the tune will be different
22/10/2020, 14:24 - Shell@chuka: @2347065636902 @2348038100535 there are games being played... the hoodlums are free to roam this time so that next time someone says EndSars you will say no don’t end sars
22/10/2020, 14:25 - Shell@chuka: Sanwo-Olu was caught between the Devil and the Deep blue sea and he has tried
22/10/2020, 14:25 - Shell@chuka: There are games being played right now and he is trying
22/10/2020, 14:26 - Shell@chuka: As for the people in Oba of Lagos palace, they are recording and sharing vids, I pity them, it’s vigilante that will come for them 😂😂
22/10/2020, 14:30 - Lulu: It is well, I have no words
22/10/2020, 14:31 - Lola@shell: In my opinion he was doing very well until he started lying on tv
22/10/2020, 14:31 - Lulu: Is it not more honorable to resign?
22/10/2020, 14:31 - Lulu: Rather than lying
22/10/2020, 14:31 - bennie@SHELL: What did he lie about?
22/10/2020, 14:31 - Lola@shell: People dying at the toll plaza
22/10/2020, 14:32 - Lulu: Although, I know it’s not easy, I’m not in his shoes, still I don’t support his response @ his speeches
22/10/2020, 14:32 - Lulu: That there was no fatality
22/10/2020, 14:32 - Lola@shell: The reasons the lights went off
22/10/2020, 14:32 - toba@SHELL: So if he resigns, what does that achieve...if you expect that all the time then your perspire to aspire man can never hold any office
22/10/2020, 14:32 - Lola@shell: He could have skipped over those parts
22/10/2020, 14:32 - Lulu: Exactly, that was a very stupid lie
22/10/2020, 14:33 - Lola@shell: It wasn't like he was being interviewed and had to answer direct questions
22/10/2020, 14:34 - Lulu: Yea if he resigns I know it might even be someone worse who comes in, but I just feel it’s more honorable to step down or sha not lie. Face the devil or deep sea head on
22/10/2020, 14:34 - Lulu: Exactly
22/10/2020, 14:34 - bennie@SHELL: I heard he updated it to one person. For him to make such a bold statement he has more info than me and you. Plus there's still no counter evidence on the number of people that actually died.
22/10/2020, 14:34 - bennie@SHELL: Does anyone have those numbers?
22/10/2020, 14:34 - Lola@shell: He's definitely way better than most of his counterparts. Jubril and his deputy can't even be compared
22/10/2020, 14:35 - toba@SHELL: Lets not forget that we lie for Shell ooo😬😁...
22/10/2020, 14:35 - Lulu: Ok didn’t know there was an update
22/10/2020, 14:35 - bennie@SHELL: <Media omitted>
22/10/2020, 14:35 - Lulu: No idea
22/10/2020, 14:35 - bennie@SHELL: Even that person said it was blunt force trauma
22/10/2020, 14:35 - bennie@SHELL: So how can we say he is lying?
22/10/2020, 14:36 - toba@SHELL: Dont mind me...but ppl should give him some slack...
22/10/2020, 14:36 - bennie@SHELL: There's a whole lot of misinformation
22/10/2020, 14:36 - bennie@SHELL: Don't just see a tweet and run with it as facts
22/10/2020, 14:36 - Lulu: I mean the numbers
22/10/2020, 14:36 - bennie@SHELL: Yes the Governor is not having s good time
22/10/2020, 14:36 - Lulu: For sure there was a fatality or were fatalities
22/10/2020, 14:36 - bennie@SHELL: But he has shown a lot of good faith in two weeks of protests
22/10/2020, 14:37 - bennie@SHELL: That even the citizens of Lagos did not reciprocate
22/10/2020, 14:37 - Lulu: Definitely he has, it’s handling the military invasion that it started going south
22/10/2020, 14:37 - bennie@SHELL: He doesn't control this
22/10/2020, 14:37 - bennie@SHELL: These are the things that young ones need to know
22/10/2020, 14:37 - bennie@SHELL: You cannot just be protesting as if you are in California
22/10/2020, 14:37 - Lulu: I know, he said it was beyond his control
22/10/2020, 14:38 - bennie@SHELL: The governor doesn't control the military
22/10/2020, 14:38 - bennie@SHELL: If something as simple as this is hard to understand
22/10/2020, 14:38 - Lulu: Is there no way he’d have sha done something?
22/10/2020, 14:38 - Lola@shell: Funny enough I agree. I've been thinking about how no one has actually come out to say their family members were lost. But then again eye witnesses said they saw deae bodies being carted away by the soldiers
22/10/2020, 14:38 - bennie@SHELL: What else? What else could he have done
22/10/2020, 14:38 - bennie@SHELL: During the day I was in Lagos
22/10/2020, 14:38 - bennie@SHELL: As at early morning law and order had broken down
22/10/2020, 14:39 - bennie@SHELL: The thugs they claimed the govt was using were fighting with police in Ketu and in Orile
22/10/2020, 14:39 - bennie@SHELL: A police station was burnt
22/10/2020, 14:39 - bennie@SHELL: Police officers were maimed and lynched
22/10/2020, 14:39 - bennie@SHELL: What else should the governor do?
22/10/2020, 14:39 - bennie@SHELL: There's a bigger Lagos than what we see online
22/10/2020, 14:39 - Lulu: Definitely so many fake news, like you said people said they watched the live video
22/10/2020, 14:40 - Lulu: Then why is the governor called the chief security officer of the state
22/10/2020, 14:40 - bennie@SHELL: Ok this is fine. But then there will be people who have missed their family members who were at the protest ground. Even if only 50 people went missing we would at least hear from their families ABI?
22/10/2020, 14:40 - Lulu: It means governors have little or no control then
22/10/2020, 14:40 - Lola@shell: I watched it and heard DJSwitch mention bodies being taken away
22/10/2020, 14:40 - bennie@SHELL: What did you see in the live video?
22/10/2020, 14:41 - bennie@SHELL: She was very brave. But I wouldn't take her words for facts.
22/10/2020, 14:41 - Lulu: I saw a dead body that night, except the person was just unconscious
22/10/2020, 14:41 - Lola@shell: I believe there are different sets of thugs. Some were brought in to discredit the protests, others are the thugs in each of those areas
22/10/2020, 14:42 - bennie@SHELL: So you see, you cannot verify this. You then choose to doubt the person that made the rounds through all hospitals?
22/10/2020, 14:42 - Lola@shell: True. She was distraught and distracted
22/10/2020, 14:43 - bennie@SHELL: This is an accurate view. Thugs are not homogenous. There are those that really hates Tinubu guts. 

I am sorry but our young protesters were painfully naive about the reality that is Nigeria
22/10/2020, 14:43 - Lulu: Why won’t I doubt him, did you hear the gunshots? So scary, very unlikely that someone wouldn’t have died
22/10/2020, 14:43 - Lulu: True
22/10/2020, 14:43 - Lola@shell: The latter are the ones looting and burning places down. The same thugs from last year
22/10/2020, 14:43 - bennie@SHELL: But where are the facts? When more than 700 Shiites were killed. We saw bodies. We saw footage. We saw kids and wives crying fo their fathers.
22/10/2020, 14:43 - Lulu: We were really naive, I must say
22/10/2020, 14:44 - Lola@shell: My thoughts exactly
22/10/2020, 14:44 - Lulu: But what else could have been done
22/10/2020, 14:44 - bennie@SHELL: This thing is not complex to me
22/10/2020, 14:44 - bennie@SHELL: Someone has carried out an unknown soldier operation
22/10/2020, 14:44 - bennie@SHELL: They didn't need to inform those in power
22/10/2020, 14:44 - bennie@SHELL: They needed it to give them plausible deniability
22/10/2020, 14:45 - bennie@SHELL: They dispersed the crowds with Gun shots
22/10/2020, 14:45 - bennie@SHELL: Didn't mean they were killing people
22/10/2020, 14:45 - bennie@SHELL: If those shots wee aimed at a crowd do you know how many bodies?
22/10/2020, 14:45 - Lulu: What if the crowd pushed back
22/10/2020, 14:49 - bennie@SHELL: Let us wait for the facts at the end of the day, but Nigeria is a complex entity.
22/10/2020, 14:50 - Lola@shell: Very
22/10/2020, 14:50 - toba@SHELL: True
22/10/2020, 14:51 - Lola@shell: I feel sorry for Sanwoolu at the end of the day. Maybe we should give him the benefit of the doubt
22/10/2020, 14:51 - Lola@shell: He is clearly powerless in a lot of ways
22/10/2020, 14:51 - Lulu: Yea, very complex. So annoying
22/10/2020, 14:51 - bennie@SHELL: When it comes to security, Governors are pawns
22/10/2020, 14:51 - bennie@SHELL: It has been this way since 1999
22/10/2020, 14:52 - bennie@SHELL: These are the things Endsars should be fighting
22/10/2020, 14:52 - Lulu: Yeaa, it’s obviously beyond him
22/10/2020, 14:52 - bennie@SHELL: A long battle for constitutional review and state police
22/10/2020, 14:52 - bennie@SHELL: It's not won on the Streets by blocking the tollgate and playing Malonogede
22/10/2020, 14:52 - bennie@SHELL: They brought out silly 5 for 5
22/10/2020, 14:53 - bennie@SHELL: Very naive
22/10/2020, 14:53 - bennie@SHELL: Smh
22/10/2020, 14:53 - Lola@shell: Not naive. Desperate
22/10/2020, 14:54 - bennie@SHELL: The money they gathered should go into fighting for the police act to change to reflect what they want......sigh no need to bother self.

There's no hope for Nigeria. I know it's hard to believe, but things will not get better at this rate.
22/10/2020, 14:54 - Lola@shell: I agree the demands are not very concise
22/10/2020, 14:54 - Lola@shell: This is where we don't want to be. "No hope for Nigeria"
22/10/2020, 14:55 - bennie@SHELL: The. I even saw people saying govt should be doing something, when they do what is right people will stop. 

I was like are you f***ing kidding me
22/10/2020, 14:55 - bennie@SHELL: Well this is how it ends
22/10/2020, 14:55 - Lola@shell: We still have hope. I do
22/10/2020, 14:56 - bennie@SHELL: 👍🏿
22/10/2020, 14:57 - Lola@shell: Rwanda was worse. So was Ghana. South Africa was hopeless. But people fought. They had hope. They made sacrifices and at the end, they won
22/10/2020, 14:57 - Lola@shell: I don't think anyone truly believed this protest would fix everything
22/10/2020, 14:57 - Lola@shell: But it's a start
22/10/2020, 14:58 - toba@SHELL: You need to define what they were fighting for and what they 'won'...
22/10/2020, 14:58 - bennie@SHELL: But it was not clear what they wanted to see
22/10/2020, 14:58 - bennie@SHELL: Govt threw many olive branches
22/10/2020, 14:59 - Lulu: I still have hope, I’d never lose hope. I believe this is a start
22/10/2020, 14:59 - Lola@shell: People wanted the olive branches to start showing signs of fruits
22/10/2020, 15:00 - bennie@SHELL: Well well farm land is burning now
22/10/2020, 15:00 - Lola@shell: The government said the same things they had said many times over the years
22/10/2020, 15:00 - bennie@SHELL: Another thing I found amusing is that people expect the police not to fight back?
22/10/2020, 15:00 - Lola@shell: They wanted them to start acting
22/10/2020, 15:00 - bennie@SHELL: See even in advanced countries like the US
22/10/2020, 15:00 - Lulu: Exactly, people felt the responses were not waterproof
22/10/2020, 15:00 - bennie@SHELL: It is extremely difficult to bring changes to the police force
22/10/2020, 15:00 - bennie@SHELL: If govt went in too heavy handed
22/10/2020, 15:01 - bennie@SHELL: They would just withdraw
22/10/2020, 15:01 - bennie@SHELL: Which is what they did to The Lagos gov
22/10/2020, 15:01 - bennie@SHELL: He was going round matching with protesters
22/10/2020, 15:01 - Lola@shell: It wasn't unexpected. That's why they didn't retaliate. Until the thugs
22/10/2020, 15:01 - bennie@SHELL: Police said ehen, ok we withdraw
22/10/2020, 15:01 - bennie@SHELL: Also it's for their safety
22/10/2020, 15:01 - Lola@shell: He doesn't have power over them
22/10/2020, 15:02 - bennie@SHELL: He doesn't have the power to deploy them to the toll gate self to protect protesters
22/10/2020, 15:02 - Lulu: It’s so stupid that a governor doesn’t have power over the police force in his state
22/10/2020, 15:02 - Lola@shell: There are people who can start these reforms
22/10/2020, 15:02 - Lola@shell: The police is centralized
22/10/2020, 15:02 - Lulu: Like Nigeria is just messed up
22/10/2020, 15:02 - bennie@SHELL: Then thugs started attacking
22/10/2020, 15:03 - bennie@SHELL: They brought bouncers 🤣🤣🤣🤣
22/10/2020, 15:03 - bennie@SHELL: Kai
22/10/2020, 15:03 - bennie@SHELL: I never see naivety like this
22/10/2020, 15:03 - Lola@shell: 🤦🏽‍♀🤦🏽‍♀
22/10/2020, 15:03 - Lulu: Yea I get, I just feel it doesn’t make sense
22/10/2020, 15:03 - bennie@SHELL: Alaye said, why will butty aje people block toll gate
22/10/2020, 15:03 - bennie@SHELL: Then they will also block their won areas
22/10/2020, 15:04 - bennie@SHELL: Even chase you away from blocking theirs
22/10/2020, 15:04 - bennie@SHELL: The thugs didn't care about Endsars
22/10/2020, 15:04 - Lola@shell: Really sad
22/10/2020, 15:05 - Lola@shell: Some people wanted to fight for that
22/10/2020, 15:05 - Lulu: So unfortunate, now we’re the ones suffering, the middle class
22/10/2020, 15:06 - Lola@shell: Yeah
22/10/2020, 15:07 - Lola@shell: The IGP is the first problem. The entire force is deeply rotten
22/10/2020, 15:08 - Lola@shell: Fashola tried a bit by establishing units for different things the police does, reducing the necessity for police on the roads
22/10/2020, 15:08 - bennie@SHELL: The IGP is a product of the system. The system is rotting and it takes time to bring changes. Even if you replace the IGP now. The next person is a problem. Except you bring someone from the outside. Even at that, the entire hierarchy is messed up.
22/10/2020, 15:10 - Lola@shell: Exactly. A friend said they should get people from the army. Bad as they are they are more disciplined than the police
22/10/2020, 15:10 - bennie@SHELL: Same same issues ehn
22/10/2020, 15:10 - bennie@SHELL: These things are very very complex issues
22/10/2020, 15:10 - bennie@SHELL: Multiple stakeholders
22/10/2020, 15:23 - Lola@shell: Yeah
22/10/2020, 15:25 - tobi@SHELL: Ogo to be honest you have spoken well
22/10/2020, 15:26 - tobi@SHELL: At least this has opened our eyes to all these realities...
22/10/2020, 15:27 - tobi@SHELL: At least we have shifted the needle a little bit. Moreover, these corrupt leaders won't back down without a fight
22/10/2020, 15:28 - tobi@SHELL: If it was going to take us 1000yrs to get it right b4, we ve now shortened it to 600yrs
22/10/2020, 15:28 - bennie@SHELL: 👍🏿👍🏿
22/10/2020, 15:41 - Lulu: Oh I see
22/10/2020, 15:42 - Lulu: 👍
22/10/2020, 16:54 - toba@SHELL: https://factcheck.afp.com/multiple-fake-accounts-twitter-impersonate-frontline-activists-nigerias-endsars-protest-heres-how
23/10/2020, 10:06 - Lola@shell: Please what exactly is happening in Oyigbo?
23/10/2020, 10:07 - Lola@shell: Is it herdsmen or soldiers?
23/10/2020, 10:08 - toba@SHELL: Ipob from what is being reported
23/10/2020, 10:09 - Lola@shell: They were apparently attacked first from videos I'm seeing
23/10/2020, 10:09 - Lola@shell: Where did you read the reports?
23/10/2020, 10:14 - toba@SHELL: Punch newspaper
23/10/2020, 10:16 - Lulu: You know that’s their headquarters, ie ipob
23/10/2020, 10:16 - toba@SHELL: Yeahh
23/10/2020, 12:17 - Lola@shell: Oh ok
23/10/2020, 15:12 - Lulu: https://www.instagram.com/tv/CGr6VhEAi2z/?igshid=1w21h7n201brk
23/10/2020, 15:12 - Lulu: An eyewitness account of what happened, such a brave lady
23/10/2020, 15:13 - Lulu: @2348076146282 please watch it and tell me what you think
23/10/2020, 15:32 - Lola@shell: I was just about to share this
23/10/2020, 15:35 - bennie@SHELL: Very sad and Traumatic event to go  through. I hope she gets better. 
I have heard this theory of the soldiers taking away dead bodies. Hopefully their families will come and speak up. 
It is a sad event no doubt, unfortunately Lagos has burst the bubble of what most of Nigeria suffers on a daily basis. 

For me, even if the death toll is 50 or 100 doesn't still change what the Army and police of Nigeria is capable of doing. 

Fela sang Unknown Soldier many decades ago. These things have unfortunately not changed since then. I hope we get to the truth of what happened.
23/10/2020, 15:40 - bennie@SHELL: Nigeria is such a dangerous country, the use of force should be the last resort to control the crowd. But even small Fulani herdsman brandish "walling sticks"(AK-47). Those are weapons of war. No police office will feel safe policing in Nigeria without one.
23/10/2020, 15:41 - bennie@SHELL: Its a deep and complex problem
23/10/2020, 15:49 - Lola@shell: When you say "even" it's actually mostly fulani herdsmen and nigerdelta militants that own arms in Nigeria. Most other people got it from the police. This is not Texas or New York. There is no reason why the average Nigerian policeman on the road should own any weapons other than tasers, tear gas and batons. Yes there should be an antirobbery unit and a counterterrorism unit and these should be the only members of the police force who are armed. These people should receive special training on proper and responsible use of weapons and they shouldn't be found patrolling the streets
23/10/2020, 15:51 - Lola@shell: But as we've said here so many times there's deep rot in the roots of this country which has to be removed first
23/10/2020, 15:58 - Lulu: You guys have said it all, for the weapons part, apart from Fulani herdsmen and militants, I know there are quite a number of weapons on the streets thanks to our useless politicians who arm touts and the likes. So it would be a hard one for the police to agree to move around without weapons. Unfortunately to all our detriment 😭
23/10/2020, 15:59 - Lulu: Thinking of Nigeria can actually get someone depressed
23/10/2020, 16:01 - bennie@SHELL: https://youtu.be/FtuqzAwFILk
23/10/2020, 16:01 - melchi 🤔: I finished this series yesterday, and ermm, this same thing that happened at Lekki toll, as well as has been happening in the past in other places, had been since the colonial era, as far back as the 1940's. No difference, its like history replaying itself, but this time, not the Colonial government, but we we
23/10/2020, 16:01 - bennie@SHELL: @2348038100535 Please watch it and tell me what you think.
23/10/2020, 16:04 - bennie@SHELL: Unfortunately, small arms are rife everywhere in Nigeria. Guns are everywhere, just think about the policemen called Yellow Fever. No one gives them any respect. They will flee once there's violence that doesn't even involve guns. 
Heck Kidnappings happen on our streets everyday with these guns. 
It is unfortunate where we are, but that ship of Batons and tasers sailed a very long time ago.
23/10/2020, 16:13 - Shell@chuka: I’ve watched this vid a few times, the story is the same anytime the army gets involved
23/10/2020, 16:14 - Lulu: My goodness!!!!!!
23/10/2020, 16:14 - bennie@SHELL: Just to point out that we didn't even stop the next day
23/10/2020, 16:14 - bennie@SHELL: This happened in Abuja not some far away place
23/10/2020, 16:14 - bennie@SHELL: Even with this evidence life moved on
23/10/2020, 16:14 - Lulu: I’ve lost hope, it means this lekki one was a small one na, so nothing it going to happen. No one would be held accountable
23/10/2020, 16:14 - bennie@SHELL: This is what I mean about the reality that is Nigeria, human life has no value
23/10/2020, 16:15 - bennie@SHELL: This is what I have been trying to say
23/10/2020, 16:15 - bennie@SHELL: There's a name it's called in psychology, it's why thousands have died in the north and it's now become just numbers to us
23/10/2020, 16:16 - bennie@SHELL: Something Vivid. I don forget the actual term
23/10/2020, 16:16 - Lulu: Really thousands have died
23/10/2020, 16:16 - bennie@SHELL: It's why when you hear Syria or Yemen despite the huge death toll, news of 3 people dying in the US will hug the headlines
23/10/2020, 16:16 - Lulu: And to think that this video was done by an international body, yet nothing has happened
23/10/2020, 16:17 - bennie@SHELL: Yup this is Nigeria anything you see take it like that.
23/10/2020, 16:17 - bennie@SHELL: Once the military gets involved just forget it
23/10/2020, 16:17 - Lulu: Why can’t they be held responsible
23/10/2020, 16:17 - bennie@SHELL: These guys will do what they want no one will bat an eyelid
23/10/2020, 16:17 - Lulu: What exactly is the problem
23/10/2020, 16:17 - bennie@SHELL: The Shiites have lost close to 1,000 people since one of them was bold enough to touch a generals chest
23/10/2020, 16:19 - Lulu: So sad, I’m lost strength jare
23/10/2020, 16:19 - Lulu: Can’t a body sue the FG?
23/10/2020, 16:19 - Lulu: Maybe an NGO or something managed outside Nigeria
23/10/2020, 16:20 - Lulu: What of the UN and the likes?
23/10/2020, 16:21 - bennie@SHELL: Everybody has their wahala
23/10/2020, 16:21 - bennie@SHELL: Nobody really cares
23/10/2020, 16:21 - Shell@chuka: Rule no 1
23/10/2020, 16:21 - bennie@SHELL: Unless they have an interest in something else I. Your country
23/10/2020, 16:22 - bennie@SHELL: Those people tagging CNN and oyibo politicians
23/10/2020, 16:22 - bennie@SHELL: Waste of time
23/10/2020, 16:22 - Shell@chuka: Asking for UN? Look at Syria and ask where UN is
23/10/2020, 16:22 - Shell@chuka: Rule no 2
23/10/2020, 16:22 - Shell@chuka: Gaberiel do you remember that UN Netflix movie?
23/10/2020, 16:22 - Shell@chuka: Sergio I think
23/10/2020, 16:23 - Lulu: 😭😭😭😭😭
23/10/2020, 16:23 - Chinwe@SHELL: Yeah....we are not their priority
23/10/2020, 16:24 - melchi 🤔: Yea, Sergio
23/10/2020, 16:24 - bennie@SHELL: Lekki is only having this effect because it is close to home
23/10/2020, 16:24 - melchi 🤔: This world na chessboard oo, we the pawns or probably something less on that board
23/10/2020, 16:25 - Shell@chuka: America is looking for what other countries to sell its weapons to
23/10/2020, 16:25 - Shell@chuka: They are not peace ambassadors
23/10/2020, 16:28 - SHELL@majek: Nigeria is very complicated. We need to understand that. And most of us probably dont know the extent of this complexity. The shiite group is considered a security threat by some quarters in the country.
23/10/2020, 16:28 - SHELL@majek: In fact, many of the issues in the middle east self can be broadly broken down across Shia Sunni lines.
23/10/2020, 16:29 - SHELL@majek: But every human life is important and everyone deserves justice. Still, this is Nigeria.
23/10/2020, 16:29 - SHELL@majek: Regular rules don't apply. We need to be aware of how things work here. We also really really really need to emphasize with others we dont have common bonds with. Fulani, IPOB, agbero. Last last, we are all human.
23/10/2020, 16:29 - Shell@chuka: But there is the number 1 rule of engagement in the military
23/10/2020, 16:29 - SHELL@majek: This is Nigeria major.
23/10/2020, 16:30 - Shell@chuka: 👆🏽
23/10/2020, 16:30 - Shell@chuka: I’m not oblivious
23/10/2020, 16:30 - SHELL@majek: I know what you are saying. It is an ideal and expected rule of engagement. The military's response doesnt surprise me. And I actually understand why they behave that way
23/10/2020, 16:31 - SHELL@majek: It's not right. But I see it from their lenses
23/10/2020, 16:31 - bennie@SHELL: 👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿👍🏿 gbam
23/10/2020, 16:31 - SHELL@majek: Its difficult. And as much as possible
23/10/2020, 16:31 - SHELL@majek: We must avoid any for of violence or escalation
23/10/2020, 16:31 - SHELL@majek: Because
23/10/2020, 16:31 - SHELL@majek: It will always end this way
23/10/2020, 16:32 - SHELL@majek: There is a study I came across cant remember where, that said human rights violation is cultural in nigeria
23/10/2020, 16:32 - melchi 🤔: What Lens 🤔
23/10/2020, 16:32 - SHELL@majek: Many of the basic cultures and norms on our society violate fundamental human rights. It just expresses it self
23/10/2020, 16:33 - SHELL@majek: A bastardized man who is told life has no value. Who is trained to see civilians as inferior. Who has seen what Islamic terrorism has done in the north. Who has psychological damage from years in the battle field. Who cant really make ends meet. Who is angry
23/10/2020, 16:34 - SHELL@majek: Now sees a Shiite demonstrating. Esp a shiite he sees as having no respect for the military. To the point of "touching a generals chest"
23/10/2020, 16:35 - SHELL@majek: I am not saying he is right. But I only expect madness from a madman.
23/10/2020, 16:36 - bennie@SHELL: Timaya sang dem mama, we play the jam dance. But it was reality. A whole village men women children was razed down by the military. 
Did anything happen?
23/10/2020, 16:36 - SHELL@majek: Well, sighs. I dont know
23/10/2020, 16:36 - bennie@SHELL: There's always a reason for them
23/10/2020, 16:36 - SHELL@majek: Nothing
23/10/2020, 16:36 - bennie@SHELL: The reason for these talk is to calibre the reality that is Nigeria.
23/10/2020, 16:36 - SHELL@majek: Human rights violation is a norm here
23/10/2020, 16:37 - bennie@SHELL: Before you go out and pump your first for any cause be sure that it is worth your life
23/10/2020, 16:37 - Alfred: I really laughed when I saw people saying “tag UN. Mail UN. Tag African leaders”. Lol. Didn’t Baba say outsiders should mind their business and watch verified news.....


It is just very complicated.
23/10/2020, 16:37 - bennie@SHELL: Don't assume that because you are peaceful you won't be killed
23/10/2020, 16:37 - Alfred: I saw the Sergio movie too but haven’t finished it 😓
23/10/2020, 16:38 - SHELL@majek: Yes. Something else that Chuka said which we dont fully grasp
23/10/2020, 16:38 - melchi 🤔: Would this be No. 3 rule. Someone was counting
23/10/2020, 16:38 - SHELL@majek: Games being played. Scripts. My people
23/10/2020, 16:39 - SHELL@majek: We all have no idea the extent of the script
23/10/2020, 16:39 - bennie@SHELL: This to
23/10/2020, 16:39 - bennie@SHELL: This is for sure
23/10/2020, 16:39 - SHELL@majek: The same way they sad down and carved up Africa and said you take here you take there
23/10/2020, 16:39 - bennie@SHELL: Don't be shocked that 2023 is on the cards
23/10/2020, 16:39 - SHELL@majek: Thay carving is still going on
23/10/2020, 16:39 - SHELL@majek: That*
23/10/2020, 16:39 - bennie@SHELL: Do we weaken some people who deemed themselves untouchable in Lagos
23/10/2020, 16:39 - SHELL@majek: By external and internal.forces
23/10/2020, 16:40 - melchi 🤔: Rule No. 4
23/10/2020, 16:40 - Lulu: https://www.instagram.com/tv/CGrwB64C_IF/?igshid=1x479v69jwehx
23/10/2020, 16:41 - Lulu: In essence you guys are saying that Falz is wasting his time in this interview 😭😭😭😭
23/10/2020, 16:41 - SHELL@majek: Always try to see beyond the smoke, to the substance. If not you become an ignorant pawn. Last last we may all be ignorant pawns. But still, if we keep searching and empathize and reason things well, maybe we may find redemption
23/10/2020, 16:43 - bennie@SHELL: He is wasting his time. I am sure he knows self.
23/10/2020, 16:43 - bennie@SHELL: Soldiers killed Fela's Mum now ABI?
23/10/2020, 16:43 - bennie@SHELL: He carried her in a coffin to dodan Barracks
23/10/2020, 16:43 - bennie@SHELL: You never listened to coffin for head of state?
23/10/2020, 16:43 - melchi 🤔: I saw this in that movie
23/10/2020, 16:45 - Lulu: 😭😭😭😭😭
23/10/2020, 16:46 - SHELL@majek: I think we should all study global conflict. And try to draw parallels with what we see. Now with the benefit of hind sight, seeing all the looting in lagos, if you could go back, will you have supported the protest in the manner it held? Point is, look at the matter broad with a huge doze of skepticism. Let's study history..we will be better for it
23/10/2020, 16:47 - Shell@chuka: I can recommend movies for this if you don’t want to read book 😂
23/10/2020, 16:47 - Chinwe@SHELL: So are we then to sit and fold our arms and allow things to rot to an irreparable point?
23/10/2020, 16:47 - Lulu: I get your point Ayo, so what is the solution
23/10/2020, 16:47 - Shell@chuka: Infact watch any of the narcos series and you have the answer
23/10/2020, 16:47 - Shell@chuka: Japka
23/10/2020, 16:47 - Lulu: Exactly, what is the solution ooo
23/10/2020, 16:47 - Lulu: Ok, solution 1, another solution?
23/10/2020, 16:47 - Shell@chuka: There’s no solution, the world will never be an ideal place
23/10/2020, 16:47 - Shell@chuka: You deal with life as it is
23/10/2020, 16:48 - Shell@chuka: You keep inching towards ideals but the rules just keep changing
23/10/2020, 16:48 - Shell@chuka: That’s all
23/10/2020, 16:48 - Lulu: But we’ve seen some countries get better over time, so Nigeria can’t be a completely hopeless case na
23/10/2020, 16:48 - Alfred: Hadn’t seen this video before. But not surprised. Had heard of the incident and the preceding incidents.
23/10/2020, 16:49 - Shell@chuka: Look at slavery/human trafficking/child labour and you’ll see that for 100s of years it’s been the same
23/10/2020, 16:50 - Shell@chuka: Fleas songs will still be relevant for 50yrs in Nigeria same way 2pacs songs are still relevant to the black men in the US till tomorrow
23/10/2020, 16:50 - Shell@chuka: Solution is you take the inch of progress you get... but don’t get carried away
23/10/2020, 16:51 - Lulu: Hmmm
23/10/2020, 16:51 - SHELL@majek: The question "what is the solution?" Over simplifies the problem. I'd rather people focus on "what are the real issues". That's a better discussion.
23/10/2020, 16:52 - SHELL@majek: But to attempt to answer the question asked, I'd say, get enlightened. Or start by accepting that "I don't know what tha heck is going on".
23/10/2020, 16:52 - Alfred: Honestly I have no solution. But I realize I am not supposed to have a solution. Our leaders should have the solution. Ideally That’s why they are leaders. The pressure should be on them to solve this mess. We provide input and pain points; they solve. Sadly leadership in Nigeria is choppings only.
23/10/2020, 16:52 - Lulu: In essence I should jakpa then
23/10/2020, 16:53 - SHELL@majek: For me sha that's what I tell myself. I try not to contribute to the problem. And I pick one issue and hack away at it. I have the problems.I am trying to solve. Get yours. But also remember, that everything you may not make a difference. Damned if you do, damned if you dont. But still do.
23/10/2020, 16:53 - bennie@SHELL: Owo
23/10/2020, 16:54 - bennie@SHELL: Owo tollgate yen
Owo tollgate yen
Mi oni le san (mi oni le san)
23/10/2020, 16:54 - bennie@SHELL: Or don't do and just drink whiskey
23/10/2020, 16:54 - tobi@SHELL: Canada, Australia, USA, Uk and even China
23/10/2020, 16:55 - Shell@chuka: I recommend Glen
23/10/2020, 16:56 - Shell@chuka: And unknown soldier
23/10/2020, 17:01 - melchi 🤔: I'm in brother
23/10/2020, 17:04 - Shell@chuka: Fela talked about how after military enquiry ‘dem talk say na unknown soldier kill e mama’ sounds like sanwo Olu saying they don’t know who was at the lekki toll gate
23/10/2020, 17:05 - melchi 🤔: Permit me to imagine that a solution can be Time
23/10/2020, 17:06 - melchi 🤔: Time births change naturally, could be good, could be bad
23/10/2020, 17:06 - bennie@SHELL: the more things change, the more they remain the same
23/10/2020, 17:06 - Shell@chuka: 😒😒
23/10/2020, 17:07 - melchi 🤔: The 'forces' that pull the world 'forward' will one day drag us with it
23/10/2020, 17:07 - melchi 🤔: 🤷🏽‍♂️
23/10/2020, 17:07 - melchi 🤔: I'm just thinking out loud
23/10/2020, 17:08 - Shell@chuka: Look at history and ask yourself if this logic works... or if that’s why ‘we are where we are’
23/10/2020, 17:08 - SHELL@majek: The forces will continue to exploit
23/10/2020, 17:08 - SHELL@majek: You or till you get sense to start playing the systen
23/10/2020, 17:08 - melchi 🤔: Where have we made progress and how did it come about 🤔
23/10/2020, 17:09 - Shell@chuka: Simple analysis, the world is an ecosystem... you fit somewhere on the food chain, ‘you can’t be a zebra and be walking around with the confidence of a lion’
23/10/2020, 17:09 - Shell@chuka: Anyway... we don try
23/10/2020, 17:09 - Shell@chuka: What’s the weekend recommendation?
23/10/2020, 17:10 - Shell@chuka: How come we’ve not done virtual drinks on this group yet?
23/10/2020, 17:10 - melchi 🤔: Seen "Over the Moon" on Netflix yet?

https://www.netflix.com/title/80214236?s=a&trkid=13747225&t=wha
23/10/2020, 17:10 - Shell@chuka: Don’t you guys miss out lunch table bants?
23/10/2020, 17:10 - melchi 🤔: Seen "Barbarians" on Netflix yet?

https://www.netflix.com/title/81024039?s=a&trkid=13747225&t=wha
23/10/2020, 17:10 - Shell@chuka: Typing is long
23/10/2020, 17:13 - Lulu: We’re currently depressed jare 😁
23/10/2020, 17:14 - Shell@chuka: wine is for all seasons my dear
23/10/2020, 17:14 - Shell@chuka: all seasons
23/10/2020, 17:16 - Lulu: 🤣🤣🤣 I agree jare
23/10/2020, 17:43 - Lola@shell: An unfortunate truth. For the time being
23/10/2020, 17:44 - Lola@shell: Don't be. Please don't accept the narrative that there's no hope. As Ayo said appreciate the minor steps towards progress first of all. One of which was this protest
23/10/2020, 17:45 - Lola@shell: Even with everything that happened I personally don't think it was a complete waste of time
23/10/2020, 17:46 - Lola@shell: We might not see any measurable change in a long time but change starts from the mind
23/10/2020, 17:46 - Lola@shell: History has shown that no body or empire can hold on to power forever
23/10/2020, 17:47 - Lola@shell: Empires rise and empires die
23/10/2020, 17:47 - Shell@chuka: It’s never a waste of time
23/10/2020, 17:47 - Lola@shell: But I'm sure none would rise if it's citizens were hopeless
23/10/2020, 17:48 - Lola@shell: True
23/10/2020, 17:50 - Lulu: True, I believe the protest was a step towards change
23/10/2020, 19:05 - bennie@SHELL: https://youtu.be/sPIho4eGeKo
23/10/2020, 19:05 - bennie@SHELL: Couldn't have put it better. Cannot expect fast food change. A lot of sense in this interview
23/10/2020, 19:23 - toba@SHELL: Very good interview
23/10/2020, 19:39 - Lola@shell: I love it
23/10/2020, 19:57 - melchi 🤔: How'd you guys watch the 52min interview in 20mins? 🤔😏🤥😮😶😐😑🙊

24/10/2020, 00:57 - Alfred: Really sad stuff

26/10/2020, 10:45 - SHELL@yusuf: U probably bought some credit with the increased tariff. They said the would reverse your outstanding on your next purchase probably what you have received now.
26/10/2020, 10:46 - toba@SHELL: Oh true...thanks

26/10/2020, 17:07 - melchi 🤔: Who's ready to band with a brother. I want to protest delayed salary payment. The protest is focused on #marginalization #non-Inclusion #mistreatment #HRbrutality #etc
26/10/2020, 17:07 - melchi 🤔: 😒
26/10/2020, 17:07 - melchi 🤔: Even my ppl in the diaspora are affected

26/10/2020, 19:43 - Lola@shell: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
26/10/2020, 19:43 - Lola@shell: Ogo brought in the yoruba guns

26/10/2020, 20:14 - Lulu: 🤣🤣🤣 I don’t even know how he comes up with these stuff
26/10/2020, 20:53 - Lola@shell: But some of us were paid days ago. Remember Oluchi mentioned it. It's actually probably a problem with your bank
26/10/2020, 21:21 - bennie@SHELL: Shebi you said they have started compiling the SoFU names 🏃🏿‍♂️🏃🏿‍♂️🏃🏿‍♂️🏃🏿‍♂️

27/10/2020, 14:48 - melchi 🤔: Put yourself first
27/10/2020, 14:50 - melchi 🤔: Some suggested principles worth actively working on:

1. Able to go, happy to stay.

2. Love it here but be ready to go.

3. Never take your salary for granted.

4. Be clear about what success/happiness in life means
27/10/2020, 15:05 - tobi@SHELL: But was it not a useful discussion
27/10/2020, 15:06 - melchi 🤔: It was oo. I recommend the class for y'all.
27/10/2020, 15:06 - Chinwe@SHELL: Nice summary Gaby

Lol. Don’t mind me o
27/10/2020, 16:48 - Alfred: Lol. Those pictures are annoying. Meanwhile why did they quote Canada appeal? Abeg they should off mic. Can’t they just use abroad appeal? 😓😓
27/10/2020, 16:50 - melchi 🤔: I've been using the REACH app to master my finances. I think you'll also find it really helpful. Use my referral code - 22XKTC - to sign up. See you in the app!
 https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.findreach.android&hl=en_US
27/10/2020, 16:50 - melchi 🤔: Tobi, you didn't tell us about this app
27/10/2020, 16:52 - tobi@SHELL: I was using it way b4 the class
27/10/2020, 16:52 - Alfred: What does it do?
27/10/2020, 16:53 - tobi@SHELL: Tracks ur expenses
27/10/2020, 17:05 - melchi 🤔: Its a cool app. Lol
27/10/2020, 17:21 - Shell.judith: 🤔
27/10/2020, 17:24 - melchi 🤔: Yes, all of you are richer than the average American 🤥
27/10/2020, 17:26 - Shell.judith: You mean Shell staff in America (before tax?)
27/10/2020, 17:26 - Shell.judith: With same career development prospects?
27/10/2020, 17:26 - melchi 🤔: You wish. Na only middle east Shell staff better pass you
27/10/2020, 17:28 - Shell.judith: Ok
27/10/2020, 17:28 - Shell.judith: And is this Shell approved course?
27/10/2020, 17:28 - Shell.judith: Sounds a bit like a pep talk for me
27/10/2020, 17:28 - Shell.judith: But I agree with the content but it looks more like lunch table conversation among friends
27/10/2020, 17:29 - Shell.judith: Not a company deliverd course
27/10/2020, 17:29 - Shell.judith: My thought sha
27/10/2020, 17:29 - melchi 🤔: The unauthenticated gist is that this course is usually targeted to people about to be SOFUED
27/10/2020, 17:29 - toba@SHELL: What do you mean by average american? You need to compare like for like
27/10/2020, 17:29 - Shell.judith: I know
27/10/2020, 17:30 - Shell.judith: Meant to provide a soft landing
27/10/2020, 17:30 - melchi 🤔: Its actually much more. I only brought the gist-worthy stuff here
27/10/2020, 17:30 - toba@SHELL: Not true...there are other courses for SOFU ppl and close to retirement
27/10/2020, 17:30 - melchi 🤔: The Average American worker
27/10/2020, 17:30 - Shell.judith: Making it look like we should be grateful we work for Shell in Nigeria
27/10/2020, 17:31 - Shell.judith: When everything else is going to pieces
27/10/2020, 17:31 - toba@SHELL: Then it'snt completely true
27/10/2020, 17:32 - melchi 🤔: Ermm  what quartile would you place a Shell staff
27/10/2020, 17:32 - Shell.judith: ☺️☺️
27/10/2020, 17:32 - melchi 🤔: Use spending power
27/10/2020, 17:34 - melchi 🤔: <Media omitted>
27/10/2020, 17:36 - toba@SHELL: This is skewed...google average income for oil and gas industry workers..lets start from there
27/10/2020, 17:36 - melchi 🤔: Nope
27/10/2020, 17:36 - melchi 🤔: Oil and Gas workers don't live a a separate world. We ALL exist on earth. Focus
27/10/2020, 17:37 - melchi 🤔: Or do you shop in a store different from the Average American
27/10/2020, 17:37 - melchi 🤔: You no wan gree say you get money abi
27/10/2020, 17:38 - toba@SHELL: If you are talking about spending power...
27/10/2020, 17:38 - Shell.judith: Remuneration is commensurate with the value the worker brings to the table
27/10/2020, 17:38 - melchi 🤔: 👆🏽
27/10/2020, 17:38 - Shell.judith: Why are CEO's paid so much, is it not the same shop?
27/10/2020, 17:38 - toba@SHELL: It is people like you that stopped us from earning in dollars🤨🤨...and removed all those benefits
27/10/2020, 17:39 - melchi 🤔: Thats not the point. The point it, you earn more than the average human being in this world. Much much more
27/10/2020, 17:39 - melchi 🤔: Remember the goal is financial Mgt.
27/10/2020, 17:40 - Shell.judith: Leave the financial mgt to us but give us more benefits
27/10/2020, 17:40 - Shell.judith: Then we can personally reach out for help managing funds even if it means getting a personal planner
27/10/2020, 17:40 - melchi 🤔: Lol. Focus.
27/10/2020, 17:41 - Shell.judith: I see the spirit of the course  but I think it is a distraction from the main thing.
27/10/2020, 17:41 - Shell.judith: If it is a pep talk to help us better our lives, cool
27/10/2020, 17:42 - Shell.judith: But people need not be 'stopped' from aspiring
27/10/2020, 17:42 - Shell.judith: And purring in the relevant work
27/10/2020, 17:42 - Shell.judith: In WOW, SCINergy, wells fellowship, ok gist
27/10/2020, 17:42 - Shell.judith: But I am just learning
27/10/2020, 17:42 - melchi 🤔: So you and Toba need more money.
27/10/2020, 17:42 - Shell.judith: What do I know
27/10/2020, 17:43 - Shell.judith: People need more value for more efforts they put
27/10/2020, 17:43 - melchi 🤔: Remember your Managers with the money they make, they're still looking for more ooo, we all are
27/10/2020, 17:43 - Shell.judith: Not necessarily money
27/10/2020, 17:43 - Shell.judith: But the pay matches the job they are doing
27/10/2020, 17:43 - Shell.judith: So, the company pays for what we do for them
27/10/2020, 17:43 - melchi 🤔: Don't let them hear you say this
27/10/2020, 17:44 - Shell.judith: My question, why is this not a global course for all OU's
27/10/2020, 17:44 - Shell.judith: It smirks like 'you guys are the lucky bunch, deal with it and be grateful '
27/10/2020, 17:46 - melchi 🤔: Not how it came across. But more of finding appreciation for where you are today, and using it as a spring board. Otherwise you run the risk of setting a goal that keeps shifting...and worse still, tying your happiness or fulfilment to it.
27/10/2020, 17:47 - Shell.judith: Okkk...
27/10/2020, 17:47 - Shell.judith: Sure, I must have taken it out of context
27/10/2020, 17:47 - Shell.judith: Thanks for the context
27/10/2020, 17:47 - Shell.judith: Yes, indeed the springboard,  I agree
27/10/2020, 17:49 - Shell.judith: Great convo, Gabby
27/10/2020, 17:50 - Chinwe@SHELL: Gaby, hope you are not losing focus
27/10/2020, 17:50 - melchi 🤔: Lol. They also sha said SOFU names dey cook for pot ooo

27/10/2020, 21:38 - toba@SHELL: You can earn over $1 million for solving a math problem. The Clay Mathematics Institute in the USA has seven problems up on their website.

28/10/2020, 09:16 - melchi 🤔: Is someone wasting time on purpose on his presentation so they don't have enough time for why we're really here. 😑
28/10/2020, 09:24 - toba@SHELL: Gabby, we need clear answers
28/10/2020, 09:25 - tobi@SHELL: Loool
28/10/2020, 09:25 - melchi 🤔: Lool. You have a typo here 👆🏽
28/10/2020, 09:26 - toba@SHELL: You are part of the kitchen cabinet
28/10/2020, 09:26 - toba@SHELL: You gave them 2weeks to prepare smooth answers🤨🤨🤨
28/10/2020, 09:27 - melchi 🤔: Chai, so they sat down at a round table and shared the questions
28/10/2020, 09:27 - toba@SHELL: You see😡😡
28/10/2020, 09:28 - tobi@SHELL: Loool
28/10/2020, 09:30 - melchi 🤔: No need. Lulu, pls end the meeting
28/10/2020, 09:37 - melchi 🤔: Wells Of Significance 🤦🏽‍♂️. Childish response.

Drilling is basic engineering not rocket science. Nothing significant about any well in SPDC
28/10/2020, 09:40 - toba@SHELL: This is also what happens when we don't develop our profile inhouse...by now we should have SMEs in a lot of areas...we have done a lot of work here
28/10/2020, 09:40 - melchi 🤔: SCiN LT is like Sanwo-Olu on CNN. They may be helpless, clueless, and probably in a worse state afterall. Maybe sympathy is what they deserve now sef. 😟
28/10/2020, 09:41 - melchi 🤔: Damage Control. 🤦🏽‍♂️
28/10/2020, 09:42 - toba@SHELL: Naah..they are like Yahaya bello🤨...denying tinz upandan
28/10/2020, 10:12 - Lulu: 🤣🤣🤣🤣 👌🏻 helpless is the word 🤣🤣🤣🤣
28/10/2020, 10:13 - Lulu: Really I don’t think they have all the answers at this stage. But at least Thierry has told us that if he had his way he would allow voluntary SOFU
28/10/2020, 10:16 - melchi 🤔: Matts initial response to the Progression question was bad, by all Leadership standards, it was very very bad
28/10/2020, 10:16 - Lulu: True, very bad, seems like someone buzzed him on the side🤣
28/10/2020, 10:16 - melchi 🤔: To the point Joe made a snide comment, as if to make fun of the question
28/10/2020, 10:16 - Lulu: He then had to return to add some words of encouragement
28/10/2020, 10:16 - Lulu: 🤣🤣🤣
28/10/2020, 10:17 - melchi 🤔: Smh
28/10/2020, 10:17 - Lulu: I didn’t even hear exactly what Joe said, sounded like a mumble
28/10/2020, 10:18 - melchi 🤔: He stressed the word OVERDUE jokingly
28/10/2020, 10:20 - melchi 🤔: Matt sha said y'all are doing jobs you should be doing. All these sitting on 4 role, sitting on 3 role, you work has been measured and you have received your due
28/10/2020, 10:20 - melchi 🤔: He said he dares you guys to dare him to prove with names and numbers that Wells is the most progressed team in SPDC. 🤦🏽‍♂️
28/10/2020, 10:22 - melchi 🤔: Uncle then came back at the end to try damage control
28/10/2020, 10:22 - Lulu: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
28/10/2020, 10:29 - Alfred: 😂😂😂 Gabby be calming down   Don be vexing
28/10/2020, 10:35 - melchi 🤔: Oh, this is running commentary. 😂
28/10/2020, 10:37 - melchi 🤔: And guess something else I learnt yesterday...under Organisational Savviness (office politics) in that workshop.

NEVER EVER TELL YOUR BOSS HOW YOU TRULY FEEL. Ill feelings specific.
28/10/2020, 10:39 - melchi 🤔: Your Boss is the co-author of your career...or career brand. So play that savviness well. 👌🏼
28/10/2020, 11:03 - Lola@shell: https://www.instagram.com/tv/CG4eA85HbHV/?igshid=1dxmr6s5cdhmo

28/10/2020, 11:53 - Lola@shell: That silly guy 🤣🤣🤣🤣. Saying all that with a straight face
28/10/2020, 12:39 - melchi 🤔: Channels shift, Arise TV come forward. 😂
28/10/2020, 12:41 - melchi 🤔: But Ghanaian Police officers sha. One time an Uber ran a red light in Ghana, I ermm initially told him we were not gonna make it, but the guy no hear word, so....
28/10/2020, 12:42 - melchi 🤔: The journey continued as planned. After like 2 minutes drive, Uncle told me that Ghana police have been following us since the Traffic light
28/10/2020, 12:42 - melchi 🤔: 🤦🏽‍♂️🤦🏽‍♂️
28/10/2020, 12:44 - melchi 🤔: Gabby: So what's up, are they like Naija police? What are we dealing with here? Is it gon be an issue? You can handle this abi.

Uber (Nigerian student in Ghana): It shouldn't be a problem. Though my drivers licence isn't authentic. I'll SETTLE him.

Gabby: 😨
28/10/2020, 12:45 - melchi 🤔: 😅😅😅🤣. Let me catch my breath first.
28/10/2020, 12:48 - melchi 🤔: So the police hilux, now behind the Uber car flags us to stop. So we pull over. One of the officers (who looks like the Chief in that Instagram post) walks up to the driver and asks him why he ran the red light. And the uber guy was mute. No word, just staring blankly at the officer. Me I was like, is this one a strategy.
28/10/2020, 12:49 - melchi 🤔: Officer asks for licence. 😮. Takes a short look and told the driver to come down from the vehicle
28/10/2020, 12:50 - melchi 🤔: Me I don dey wan end Trip for Uber app. Book fresh trip
28/10/2020, 12:51 - melchi 🤔: Meanwhile, they took this Uber guy to where their Hilux was and opened the door, and the Uber guy calmly entered the hilux
28/10/2020, 12:51 - Alfred: 😂😂😂😂 na we we las las
28/10/2020, 12:52 - Alfred: 😂😂😂😂😂 no settling? What happened?
28/10/2020, 12:52 - melchi 🤔: Me I've ended trip by then. Booking fresh trip.
28/10/2020, 12:52 - Alfred: 😂
28/10/2020, 12:53 - melchi 🤔: Next thing i see Uber driver running back to our car. He enters, I go whats up. He says 'settled'
28/10/2020, 12:53 - melchi 🤔: Gabby: So why all the paparazzi na
Uber: We were negotiating 'price' after they threatened to take him to station
28/10/2020, 12:55 - melchi 🤔: So apparently, after first speaking with the first officer, as they couldn't agree on settlement fee. He was invited to go talk to their Chairman at the owners corner of the Hilux. 🤦🏽‍♂️
28/10/2020, 12:57 - melchi 🤔: Chairman told him point blank that  he's not even interested in going to station. Na bribe dem want, and that's why they're at the Traffic light
28/10/2020, 12:58 - melchi 🤔: This chairman now advised him that anytime he wants to bribe an officer, he shouldn't do it in the open. He should either enter their car or invite the officer into his car.
28/10/2020, 12:59 - melchi 🤔: 👀
28/10/2020, 12:59 - melchi 🤔: All exchanges must happen under COVER. 😁

28/10/2020, 21:16 - Lola@shell: Don't remind me. I'm getting ready to be mobilised for more nose and throat chooking plus 28 days in the back of beyond and I really don't feel like it. 😥😥
28/10/2020, 21:19 - bennie@SHELL: There's no time of the year when one is not tired of this.
28/10/2020, 21:21 - Lola@shell: 😂😂😂😂. It's worse now. I'm almost depressed.

09/11/2020, 15:24 - bennie@SHELL: 😁😁😁 Go and check how many times a court granted Dasuki bail.
09/11/2020, 15:25 - bennie@SHELL: Even when various courts did
09/11/2020, 15:25 - bennie@SHELL: He was still held in jail
09/11/2020, 15:25 - bennie@SHELL: The law is what they want it to be
09/11/2020, 15:25 - Lulu: Oh true, I heard of this
09/11/2020, 15:25 - bennie@SHELL: If someone leaked this WhatsApp chat
09/11/2020, 15:25 - bennie@SHELL: They will come and carry you for asking if they are stupid
09/11/2020, 15:25 - bennie@SHELL: And hashtag will not save you
09/11/2020, 15:26 - Lulu: 😭😭😭😭
09/11/2020, 15:28 - buari@SHELL: Is this what's happening in Nigeria now?
09/11/2020, 15:28 - bennie@SHELL: Don't be sad, you need to be ready to fight before you jump in the ring
09/11/2020, 15:29 - bennie@SHELL: People went to protest on Abuja, a magistrate remanded them in custody I think till sometimes in January I believe



Including the journalist
09/11/2020, 15:29 - bennie@SHELL: In fact there is a boy who is 15, they changed his age to 20 and added him to those remanded
09/11/2020, 15:29 - bennie@SHELL: This is according to their lawyers
09/11/2020, 15:30 - bennie@SHELL: They have now been moved to Suleja prison
09/11/2020, 15:30 - buari@SHELL: Oh wow, I thought the judiciary was independent? All the institutions in that country are kwarrupt, walahi
09/11/2020, 15:30 - bennie@SHELL: 😒😒😒 all I can say is just follow Mr Buari's actions
09/11/2020, 15:30 - bennie@SHELL: Forget what he says
09/11/2020, 15:36 - Lulu: Mehnn I’m in shock @ Mr Buari. I wish the US can depot you so that you come and experience your lover and almost namesake first hand 😝
09/11/2020, 15:41 - buari@SHELL: Lol... I don't need to be in Nigeria to experience Nigeria. I have assets in Nigeria
09/11/2020, 15:42 - Lola@shell: The sad thing about this option is that people who take it willingly can't run for office in Nigeria. Some of our future leaders are now Canadian and American citizens
09/11/2020, 15:42 - Lola@shell: The whole situation is disheartening
09/11/2020, 15:43 - bennie@SHELL: Who says you cannot ni?
09/11/2020, 15:43 - Lola@shell: The constitution
09/11/2020, 15:43 - Lola@shell: Unless it's changed in the near future
09/11/2020, 15:43 - bennie@SHELL: Ok if you take it willingly yes for some positions
09/11/2020, 15:44 - bennie@SHELL: But then you dont have to run
09/11/2020, 15:44 - Lola@shell: Yeah
09/11/2020, 15:44 - buari@SHELL: I think its probably only the president
09/11/2020, 15:44 - bennie@SHELL: There's organising
09/11/2020, 15:44 - bennie@SHELL: I think also governors
09/11/2020, 15:44 - Lola@shell: Even down to House of Reps
09/11/2020, 15:44 - buari@SHELL: But Saraki has dual citizenship
09/11/2020, 15:44 - Lola@shell: Maybe he was born abroad
09/11/2020, 15:45 - Lulu: Wow! So it means we’ve lost so many future leaders
09/11/2020, 15:45 - bennie@SHELL: He was so it was not willingly
09/11/2020, 15:45 - bennie@SHELL: So he can do anything
09/11/2020, 15:45 - Lola@shell: @2348023057857 Buari... maybe you'd have been our saviour 😂😂😂
09/11/2020, 15:46 - buari@SHELL: Lol... I am coming back
09/11/2020, 15:46 - Lola@shell: But then again I think this period is exceptionally bad because of Buhari
09/11/2020, 15:46 - Lola@shell: I hope they hand over power willingly
09/11/2020, 15:46 - bennie@SHELL: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I also have Beachfront froferties in Daura for sale
09/11/2020, 15:46 - Lola@shell: That's why 2023 is important
09/11/2020, 15:47 - Shell@chuka: ‘For some reason I smell another Jonathan/ Buhari situation. People being in such a hurry to vote someone out that they don't look too closely at who they're voting in’
09/11/2020, 15:47 - Lola@shell: I'm also selling Lekki-Ikoyi link bridge 🤣🤣🤣🤣
09/11/2020, 15:47 - Lola@shell: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 lmaooo
09/11/2020, 15:48 - Lola@shell: Making me eat my words
09/11/2020, 15:48 - bennie@SHELL: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
09/11/2020, 15:48 - buari@SHELL: Wellll... I'm officially supporting Osibanjo / El Rufai. Y'all can support Wike
09/11/2020, 15:48 - Lola@shell: El what?
09/11/2020, 15:48 - Shell@chuka: You see am
09/11/2020, 15:48 - bennie@SHELL: Little finger
09/11/2020, 15:49 - bennie@SHELL: If that guys smells power ehn
09/11/2020, 15:49 - Lola@shell: I think we should use @2348023057857's candidates as a "don't vote " list
09/11/2020, 15:49 - bennie@SHELL: 👍🏿👍🏿 you won't go wrong
09/11/2020, 15:49 - Shell@chuka: 😂😂😂
09/11/2020, 15:49 - Lola@shell: Please who should we vote for as Lagos state governor @2348023057857 ?
09/11/2020, 15:50 - buari@SHELL: There's no vacancy till 2027
09/11/2020, 15:50 - bennie@SHELL: Osibanjo and mike Pence sold their political birthrights for porridge
09/11/2020, 15:50 - Shell@chuka: Is like you’ve forgotten how sanwo Olu won
09/11/2020, 15:50 - Lola@shell: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
09/11/2020, 15:51 - Lola@shell: Noo... I want Mayowa's golden opinion
09/11/2020, 15:51 - bennie@SHELL: Or until the oracle of Bourdillon decides that Baba Ijebu should be the next governor you too will switch
09/11/2020, 15:51 - buari@SHELL: What options did Mike Pence have
09/11/2020, 15:52 - buari@SHELL: Loool... if you have a better choice than the oracle, put him forward, canvass for him and get him elected
09/11/2020, 15:52 - Lulu: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
09/11/2020, 15:52 - Lulu: Yea but can anyone be worse than Bubu?
09/11/2020, 15:52 - Lola@shell: Step down or at least be a bit more vocal in his views
09/11/2020, 15:52 - bennie@SHELL: What's my business, me I am walking my talk.
09/11/2020, 15:53 - Shell@chuka: Canada way
09/11/2020, 15:53 - bennie@SHELL: Thing will only get worse, since 2015 lunch table. Till tomorrow till at least the next 5 to 10 years
09/11/2020, 15:53 - Lola@shell: Watch this space. Unless Bubu gets them firsr
09/11/2020, 15:54 - Lulu: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🙌🙌🙌🙌 supported
09/11/2020, 15:54 - Lola@shell: In my optimistic sunshine and unicorns way I think new leaders are rising
09/11/2020, 15:54 - buari@SHELL: Politics is a series of negotiations. He is getting what the conservative bloc wants through Trump. Why should he step down?
09/11/2020, 15:55 - Lulu: 🤣🤣🤣🤣😭😭😭😭😭 “who is Mike Pence sef” I pity the guy, he was drowned under Trump’s shadow
09/11/2020, 15:55 - buari@SHELL: Thank you... There's hope for Nigeria
09/11/2020, 15:55 - Lola@shell: I get that it's a bit more complicated than we know sha. Cos I've also been trying to rationalise Osibajo
09/11/2020, 15:56 - Lola@shell: Halleluhah
09/11/2020, 15:57 - Lulu: The best I can do is hope sha, as I don’t have any other passport
09/11/2020, 15:57 - Lola@shell: Really? Maybe there's a hidden picture we can't see
09/11/2020, 15:57 - Lola@shell: My sister, I'm reconsidering that o
09/11/2020, 15:57 - Lola@shell: This country is a scary place
09/11/2020, 15:58 - Lola@shell: Let me be optimistic from a safe distance
09/11/2020, 15:58 - Lulu: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I feel you. I’m still considering sha
09/11/2020, 16:04 - buari@SHELL: <Media omitted>
09/11/2020, 16:06 - melchi 🤔: <Media omitted>
09/11/2020, 16:45 - tobi@SHELL: Yinmuuuu...  osibanjo isn't gonna be on any ticket
10/11/2020, 09:19 - Lulu: Good morning guys. Please plan to join the COG townhall by 10am this morning. I’d be coming to you guys for feedback on the session😁
10/11/2020, 12:26 - melchi 🤔: Lulu, what did your Boss say
10/11/2020, 12:35 - Lulu: Many things. Don’t worry the replay would be posted on yammer in the coming days
10/11/2020, 12:35 - melchi 🤔: Na summary i need.  #Fastlane
10/11/2020, 12:35 - Lulu: Split according to the agenda so you can listen to the aspect you’re interested in
10/11/2020, 12:36 - Lulu: OYO for you
10/11/2020, 12:36 - melchi 🤔: You owe us commentary
10/11/2020, 12:37 - Lulu: I sha suspect that FE would be badly hit after reshape/franchising
10/11/2020, 12:37 - Lulu: Judging from what I heard today
10/11/2020, 12:38 - Lulu: Further 10% FTE reduction next year, this is Wells global (I think)
10/11/2020, 12:39 - Lulu: As usual can’t share the details of reshape yet, but mor would begin March next year for EC-3 and below
10/11/2020, 12:39 - melchi 🤔: They've said these pne b4 , abi they just repeated old stuff to drive the point
10/11/2020, 12:40 - melchi 🤔: Issokay
10/11/2020, 12:40 - melchi 🤔: We dey look 👀
10/11/2020, 12:42 - tobi@SHELL: Franchising can't be completed by then.. because of ncdmb franchising is on a slow part here
10/11/2020, 12:43 - Lulu: Ok, I wonder how they would cross that ncdmb huddle sha
10/11/2020, 12:44 - melchi 🤔: Still don't understand this Franchise sha
10/11/2020, 12:44 - melchi 🤔: Shey someone said that's how ExxonMobil operates
10/11/2020, 12:45 - melchi 🤔: Kosi, true?
10/11/2020, 12:46 - Shell.judith: The focus will possibly be on operations
10/11/2020, 12:46 - melchi 🤔: If that model already exists in naija,  implementing it won't be a problem
10/11/2020, 12:46 - melchi 🤔: Operations is pretty stable next year
10/11/2020, 12:47 - melchi 🤔: To an extent, operations was stable this year...depending on how you look at it
10/11/2020, 12:48 - toba@SHELL: My own question is that i hear that the message of reshape is that value is more important than volumes. How does that play in Nigeria where funding e.g. AF depends on volumes?
10/11/2020, 12:49 - melchi 🤔: Nigeria is unique
10/11/2020, 12:50 - melchi 🤔: Halting SSAGS will cost more than keeping operations going even in the midst of Opec cuts or covid19
10/11/2020, 12:50 - melchi 🤔: Thats AF
10/11/2020, 13:10 - Kosi: Not sure what franchising means
10/11/2020, 14:12 - melchi 🤔: Hmm, its the buzz word around this place. Not sure what it is too
10/11/2020, 14:12 - Shell@chuka: Franchising is pretty much standardizing designs... reduce custom designs for wells
10/11/2020, 14:14 - Lulu: https://www.menti.com/wh93hr829r
10/11/2020, 14:14 - Lulu: A quick feedback on the townhall would be appreciated
10/11/2020, 14:15 - melchi 🤔: Why is this a focus, the drive for  standardisation have tayd na
10/11/2020, 14:15 - melchi 🤔: And then, it seems like something that'll affect people count
10/11/2020, 14:16 - Shell@chuka: Because we are still customizing the same types of wells
10/11/2020, 14:16 - Shell@chuka: And because you typically ‘save’ a lot in your contracting if you standardize designs
10/11/2020, 14:17 - Shell@chuka: And you shorten the delivery time for projects (remember that year you used to complain about working on projects that are 5yrs away)
10/11/2020, 14:17 - melchi 🤔: Totally get these benefits, but guys are on the edge with this word
10/11/2020, 14:17 - melchi 🤔: The people impact?
10/11/2020, 14:18 - Shell@chuka: Lmao... you are assistant GM, we should be asking you
10/11/2020, 14:18 - melchi 🤔: 😟
10/11/2020, 14:19 - melchi 🤔: Thierry did say something about the early stages of design, DG1, DG2 been centralized
10/11/2020, 14:19 - melchi 🤔: This means they'll be done outside the OU I guess
10/11/2020, 14:20 - Shell@chuka: Anyway, at GMs level I don’t think they have all the information yet... had a meeting with GMs trying to plan for next year and most of them did it’s too early to plan for next year  cos they ‘don’t know the details of reshape yet’
10/11/2020, 14:20 - melchi 🤔: I thought this was franchise. 🤔. Looks like its not
10/11/2020, 14:20 - Lulu: As a business, I think franchising is good, it should be more optimal. I just hopes it works in Nigeria (ie the Supply chain value to be gained)
10/11/2020, 14:21 - melchi 🤔: This uncertainty reach GMs Level? 🤦🏽‍♂️
10/11/2020, 14:22 - tobi@SHELL: Following franchising will totally knock out local players which NCDMB doesn't align to
10/11/2020, 14:23 - Lulu: *hope
10/11/2020, 14:23 - Lulu: Yea
10/11/2020, 14:24 - melchi 🤔: Can someone take a break and come back when all this is settled. 🤐
10/11/2020, 14:31 - Shell@chuka: Actually a smart decision
10/11/2020, 14:31 - Shell@chuka: 😂
10/11/2020, 16:25 - SHELL@yusuf: <Media omitted>

13/11/2020, 10:38 - Kosi: God i apologise on his behalf...
13/11/2020, 10:39 - Kosi: Chuka look at the number of people that are accepting this. God why 🤧😭😭😭😭😭

13/11/2020, 15:59 - Alfred: i saw this. despite the facts in there, there is quite some exaggeration. buhari is not necessarily abacha returned. he is just buhari. my opinion. and this era is really nothing compared to military in terms of freedom of the people. young people do not know, let us not form itk
13/11/2020, 16:05 - melchi 🤔: I would think he is referring to the political climate under this administration
13/11/2020, 16:05 - melchi 🤔: Not like buhari as a person
13/11/2020, 16:06 - SHELL@yusuf: I agree with you, our democracy is a road with turns, the type of democracy that has brought use this far cannot continue absolutely into the next turn. I see these as the teething problem as we proceed into the new era of our democracy both leaders and led are experiencing it.
13/11/2020, 16:07 - melchi 🤔: He went into exile sha, whatever drove him to that point is probably where he is writing from
13/11/2020, 16:11 - SHELL@yusuf: Going into exile shows your position on the ladder of hardship currently being experienced in all, the worst hit clearly have no voice neither is exile an option that is available to them
13/11/2020, 16:14 - SHELL@yusuf: Have u seen the average age of the leaders in Nigeria and Ghana from 50s to 90s it will stand at about 30yrs. I guess since we cannot do the things they did we might as well be patient with the pace.
13/11/2020, 16:15 - melchi 🤔: Lol
13/11/2020, 16:16 - melchi 🤔: Patience, I want to be patient like Alfy and Bennie

13/11/2020, 16:31 - SHELL@yusuf: Most presidents should be guaranteed 2 terms going by this, a clear case of many roads lead to the seat of power.
13/11/2020, 16:32 - melchi 🤔: The work is in doing enough fo discredit the primary process.
13/11/2020, 16:41 - SHELL@yusuf: He already started it during the election.
13/11/2020, 17:18 - bennie@SHELL: Lol .... this you?

27/11/2020, 09:03 - melchi 🤔: I did give my feedback sha, that the manual looks too good to be true. But dem say make we fire down
27/11/2020, 09:03 - bennie@SHELL: Is there SHALL statement inside ?
27/11/2020, 09:04 - melchi 🤔: Brother, I don go solid my leg for here oo. Land rig? Na na na na ☺️
27/11/2020, 09:04 - bennie@SHELL: Anyways please SPDC rooms need upgrade
27/11/2020, 09:04 - bennie@SHELL: We need bigger screen TV's for one

27/11/2020, 09:07 - melchi 🤔: Thats how Joe will appoint you as the Authorised Person as per the manual
27/11/2020, 09:07 - melchi 🤔: You look like a good candidate
27/11/2020, 09:07 - Lulu: In your dreams
27/11/2020, 09:08 - melchi 🤔: Abi, it Bennie sef, so we get Toronto standards on our sites
27/11/2020, 09:10 - melchi 🤔: But seriously, if that manual is implemented and effective, I will consider this Isolation Allowance finally and head back to site
27/11/2020, 09:10 - melchi 🤔: Sop typing bennie
27/11/2020, 09:10 - melchi 🤔: Stop *
27/11/2020, 09:10 - Lulu: Like the Isolation allowance would be there forever 🤣
27/11/2020, 09:10 - bennie@SHELL: Can DSV shut down rig because of food endurance?or if AC stops working ?
27/11/2020, 09:11 - Lulu: 🤣🤣🤣🤣 if I hear, on paper sha he can
27/11/2020, 09:11 - Lulu: For food endurance, I think Dozie has done so before
27/11/2020, 09:11 - bennie@SHELL: Anyways I am learning to be optimistic these days. All my pessimism about UsD exchange rate has not changed the fact that it is going up. So let me try optimism
27/11/2020, 09:12 - melchi 🤔: If I'm the DSV, ill try my 'LUCK'
27/11/2020, 09:12 - bennie@SHELL: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
27/11/2020, 09:12 - bennie@SHELL: That's how a certain Alfred brought his oyibo projections and try your luck to the rig
27/11/2020, 09:12 - melchi 🤔: 😂
27/11/2020, 09:12 - melchi 🤔: Aaaah, so we have a victim, no need then
27/11/2020, 09:13 - bennie@SHELL: He can give you the story na👴🏿👴🏿👴🏿 told him rillakssss he was doing young blood
27/11/2020, 09:14 - bennie@SHELL: He is lucky we held village meeting to rescue him from the Rig
27/11/2020, 09:15 - melchi 🤔: Lol. Alfy, you didn't tell me you had this experience. Its good to see you smiling after all
27/11/2020, 09:17 - SHELL@yusuf: I see we try so hard to want to be seen as caring but don't really care. I mit be wrong but we don't need this much paper work to care. We have been lacking printer cartridge for 4months on my rig, I ve escalated, my escalatee has further escalated up to 4th generation escalation no result. Last was yemi calling to ask me if Next sells it. Yet Alice won't stop painting reds for hsse gaps when TRIC can't be printed.

27/11/2020, 09:22 - toba@SHELL: Gabby, action point for your scrum team...lets make existing initiatives work well...if not, new ones would be seen as scam
27/11/2020, 09:23 - melchi 🤔: This is a Global Initiative though
27/11/2020, 09:23 - melchi 🤔: But there isn't any existing initiatives, or is there? 🙊
27/11/2020, 09:24 - SHELL@yusuf: Time will tell, does rig working/welfare condition focus team championed by Effy ring a bell? The open actions are still open till date
27/11/2020, 09:24 - melchi 🤔: Cos no ownership i would presume.
27/11/2020, 09:25 - melchi 🤔: I guess if Joe has to answer someone higher up on Care Issues, he may own it
27/11/2020, 09:26 - melchi 🤔: Reshape has put some fire in certain bones
27/11/2020, 09:26 - melchi 🤔: We can take advantage of that
27/11/2020, 09:27 - toba@SHELL: Which fire?? Abegiii
27/11/2020, 09:27 - melchi 🤔: 😟

27/11/2020, 09:50 - Lulu: 🙈🙈🙈🙈 I thought some progress was made in the WI space
27/11/2020, 11:03 - Lulu: Guys when putting in the value of your car for an insurance form, do you put the value for a brand new of that model (even if you initially putout as fairly used)?
27/11/2020, 11:10 - Lulu: Never mind, it’s the depreciated value (thanks to Gabby)
27/11/2020, 11:10 - melchi 🤔: Oooo, now you've mentioned my name, Bennie will come with 📌

30/11/2020, 13:43 - Lulu: Imagine, he should wake the dead up and tell them. Such stupidity, of what use is this information? Is it going to bring them back to life? All they’re conver about is who to transfer the blame to
30/11/2020, 14:32 - Kosi: Anyone have Aero contact? Want to reschedule a flight
30/11/2020, 14:59 - tobi@SHELL: The best is to have someone at the airport that can help u
30/11/2020, 14:59 - tobi@SHELL: Like ur logistics staff

06/12/2020, 11:28 - Shell.judith: The way we are counting on remittances from diaspora,  I wonder if we are deliberately encouraging brain drain so that the remittances can increase. Hmm
06/12/2020, 11:30 - Shell@chuka: Just like a poor man wanting his children to marry rich so that something can drop every now and then 😂

09/12/2020, 08:57 - melchi 🤔: Dial in and come and ask
09/12/2020, 08:58 - Lulu: Don’t bother asking o, response would be “work in progress” or not yet cleared to discuss
09/12/2020, 08:58 - Shell@chuka: Who is Onafeso
09/12/2020, 08:59 - Shell@chuka: Why are we so thankful to leaders doing their jobs

09/12/2020, 09:07 - Lulu: I get your point sha, but I think it was more of him thanking the presenter, I’m sure he’d have done same too if it was another person (not a leader). I think Tunde is quite chatty, at least from last week’s town hall
09/12/2020, 09:07 - Shell@chuka: He did too much
09/12/2020, 09:07 - Shell@chuka: Thank you for your honesty

09/12/2020, 09:08 - Shell@chuka: Thank you for steering us through such COVID times
09/12/2020, 09:08 - Lulu: Tunde talks, you guys would have noticed from the last townhall
09/12/2020, 09:08 - Shell@chuka: 😒😒😒
09/12/2020, 09:08 - Shell@chuka: That’s why I asked who he was
09/12/2020, 09:08 - bennie@SHELL: Gabby tell us o because it's like an emergent strategy is happening here
09/12/2020, 09:08 - toba@SHELL: Are u serious? He said all that!!!! Na wa ooo
09/12/2020, 09:08 - Lulu: I guess he’s still navigating through this VTH thingy

09/12/2020, 09:09 - Shell@chuka: It happens a lot when we have such meetings... it’s a cultural thing
09/12/2020, 09:09 - melchi 🤔: You never see sontin. He spent the 15 opening minutes of last week townhall talking...alone
09/12/2020, 09:09 - Lulu: Even if he does, I’d be shocked if he says anything about it
09/12/2020, 09:09 - bennie@SHELL: We will know last
09/12/2020, 09:09 - Shell@chuka: The last time is was Matthias that we were throwing wrapper on the floor for him to walk on

24/12/2020, 08:30 - SHELL@yusuf: Goodmorning All .
Stopped by this morning at Oando filling station by Doxa to purchase petrol and was told the story of a customer who  had just evaded a probable robbery or kidnap attack.
He was driving from Sasun roundabout coming down the Odili Road when he noticed a car following him. All of a sudden the car overtook him and a man holding a walkie talkie beckoned unto him to stop.There were four in number in the car all in mufti and he was tempted to stop but his instinct told him they were not police men so he sped on and entered the Oando filling station and the car drove away.
Vigilance at all times is key as this is an incident too many in these times.

08/01/2021, 19:28 - melchi 🤔: Definition of the Market Place
10/01/2021, 10:29 - SHELL@yusuf: Today at the Port-Harcourt international Airport Omagwa I had a terrible and annoying experience. 

I had gone to the Airport to drop my wife who was travelling to Lagos. 
On getting to the Airport I dropped her off in front of the departure hall, came down from the car and brought down her luggage, and drove to the car park. I quickly parked and went to the departure hall to bid her farewell. 

Since I was not allowed to enter the departure due to Covid19 regulations I had to quickly wave her good bye from a distance and return to the car park.
On getting back to the car park just within a space of 5 minutes or less I noticed that some persons have quickly locked the front wheel and tyre with a heavy chain and padlock. 

When I looked around i saw the same people that impounded my vehicle locking another vehicle nearby. So I approached them to find out the offence I had committed that warranted them to impound the vehicle. Then I was thinking probably there is a parking ticket am meant to buy that i didn't buy. So on asking them, they said that I parked my vehicle in between the demarcation line. 
That was when I looked carefully to see a very faint and unclear line that was covered with dust and sand. 

I smiled and asked them how much was the fine so I could quickly pay and take my car home thinking that it would be around N2000 or at most N5000, and to my greatest surprise and chagrin, the lady amongst them said it was N15,000. I said to myself " what kind of country is this that sets traps for people instead of guiding you right.  The said demarcation line is not clear at all and secondly I had barely parked within a a space of 5 minutes to say good bye and these people descended on my vehicle like hungry vultures to impound it". 

I got angry but then i quickly controlled myself and demanded to see the person in charge of the unit.  I was directed to meet a lady sitting under an umbrella at a corner in the car park I approached her and introduced myself and begged her to pardon me but she refused to budge, that was when I told her I am an ex-personel of the Nigerian Army and she said I should show evidence or get the soldiers at the Airport to intervene before they would release my vehicle. I asked them where the military base at the airport was located. They directed me and on getting there after identifying myself; they said it was beyond their powers to ask them to release my vehicle unless I get in touch with the Airport Commandant. I had to call a serving Army General friend of mine who now called the commandant that ordered the soldiers to escort me to the car park and make sure the vehicle was released immediately. 

On getting to the car park the lady in Charge wanted to act funny by asking the soldiers to go and that they would release the vehicle; but the soldiers said NO that the order was to get the vehicle released to me immediately. And so that was how they reluctantly went to the car to remove the chains and padlock. 

At that car park I saw other vehicles of unsuspecting visitors at the airport that these people had impounded. This is really very bad and wicked. 

Please lets be careful any time you drive into Port-Harcourt airport or any Airport in Nigeria there are alot of touts and traps everywhere in these airports waiting for unsuspecting persons to fall prey. 

I want to implore the people in charge of the Port-Harcourt airport car park to make these demarcation lines visible so as to justify their actions and give their "good job" a human face.  Times are hard and these people are making it harder; besides this is January.
 
Be guided before you become a victim.

15/01/2021, 09:37 - bennie@SHELL: Everyone can do everything
15/01/2021, 09:38 - bennie@SHELL: What was the use of the impacted or not
15/01/2021, 09:38 - toba@SHELL: I am confused as well
15/01/2021, 09:38 - Shell@chuka: Bros you know how the thing goes
15/01/2021, 09:39 - tobi@SHELL: Na wa oooohhhh... this whole excercise isn't funny sha
15/01/2021, 09:41 - Lulu: Don’t be deceived o, those impacted would be given more preference. I also suspect some level of staff refresh would be done (that’s what they called talent placement, so IPF might come in) #myopinion
15/01/2021, 09:56 - Shell@chuka: Who was our former EVP
15/01/2021, 09:57 - Alfred: Paul Goodfellow.
15/01/2021, 09:57 - Lulu: Hmmm forgotten his name, the guy whose wife was ill
15/01/2021, 09:57 - Lulu: Exactly
15/01/2021, 09:57 - Alfred: He moved to EVP DW when Gallagher came in.
15/01/2021, 09:58 - toba@SHELL: Warrapened
15/01/2021, 09:58 - Shell@chuka: Nothing
15/01/2021, 09:58 - Lulu: Yea
15/01/2021, 09:59 - Shell@chuka: John Gallagher was never a wells guy, he was from development
15/01/2021, 09:59 - Shell@chuka: Someone is telling me that the new GM can very easily be another Development guy 😂
15/01/2021, 10:01 - Lulu: Hmmm possibly o, but I hope not sha
15/01/2021, 10:05 - Alfred: Hahah. Yes. He was development. In fact someone literally told me ‘best wishes & have fun with John’. Lol. 
Yup, our new wells Gm can very easily be a UK or Dutch development guy. 😀
15/01/2021, 10:08 - toba@SHELL: Yeah but he was a typical PE  recruit then...he must have worked as a wellsite engineer...
15/01/2021, 10:08 - Lulu: I hear it might be difficult to bring in an expatriate to that role, I hope so
15/01/2021, 11:00 - melchi 🤔: 92 msgs. This must be serious
15/01/2021, 11:00 - melchi 🤔: 👀
15/01/2021, 11:19 - SHELL@yusuf: We the pipu of the niger delta, custodians of our oyel will not accept that, recall we already issued a warning that GM wells is a nigeria role, u pipu be warned.👹
15/01/2021, 11:32 - melchi 🤔: Now that this is out of the way, Alfy, Omale, Lulu, time to update your funnels on WEIS.
15/01/2021, 11:33 - melchi 🤔: Don't worry, this is not like last year, no chasing, just simple reminders

15/01/2021, 11:40 - melchi 🤔: Plans underway. The funnels will be on #baller mode this year.
15/01/2021, 15:31 - Alfred: Lol. I’m tempted to ask which funnels but I think I know what you are doing
15/01/2021, 15:42 - melchi 🤔: Throw, no shed, no give some light Sir. 😁
15/01/2021, 16:47 - Alfred: Lol. There is no funnel na. The string is gone.
15/01/2021, 17:37 - tobi@SHELL: https://www.shell.com/media/news-and-media-releases/2021/spdc-completes-sale-of-interest-in-oil-mining-lease-17-in-nigeria.html

The Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (SPDC), has completed the sale of its 30% interest in Oil Mining Lease (OML) 17 in the Eastern Niger Delta, and associated infrastructure, to TNOG Oil and Gas Limited, a related company of Heirs Holdings Limited and Transnational Corporation of Nigeria Plc (Transcorp), for a consideration of $533m. A total of $453m was paid at completion with the balance to be paid over an agreed period.

15/01/2021, 18:07 - melchi 🤔: SPDC retaining IA and RA, which fall within the lease.
15/01/2021, 18:08 - melchi 🤔: This retain be like, SPDC rented IA and RA from Tony Elumelu and Co.
15/01/2021, 18:09 - melchi 🤔: 😁
15/01/2021, 19:16 - Alfred: Loool. Shay they were asking people who want to come and live in ra to fill form. At this rate they will need non shell staff to populate RA. Hmm. Business ideas.

18/01/2021, 13:45 - Kosi: Thank you thank you
18/01/2021, 14:26 - melchi 🤔: Who attended the Townhall
18/01/2021, 14:26 - melchi 🤔: E be like dem divest asset plus human resource.
18/01/2021, 14:27 - melchi 🤔: I didn't attend, but Dozie said as from Friday, all production from OML 17 is owned by the New Owners
18/01/2021, 14:28 - melchi 🤔: And Staff working in those Assets are working for the new owners
18/01/2021, 14:32 - toba@SHELL: Yuppp
18/01/2021, 14:33 - melchi 🤔: IA, RA
18/01/2021, 14:33 - melchi 🤔: Can we work from home permanently
18/01/2021, 14:37 - Lulu: Nah, some days I miss the office, ie the people
18/01/2021, 14:39 - melchi 🤔: But your office is on sold land.
18/01/2021, 14:39 - Alfred: Just like that? Interesting. For production guys on the field maybe very logical. What of the sub surface guys, PTs , reservoir Engrs and even well intervention teams, they also move to heir holdings?
18/01/2021, 14:39 - melchi 🤔: Landlord can chase you out when you misbehave, or when he feels like it.
18/01/2021, 14:40 - Lulu: IA and RA were out of scope
18/01/2021, 14:40 - Lulu: Is that not what they communicated?
18/01/2021, 14:40 - Alfred: Well, the sold portion is the right to produce hydrocarbon. If IA was in scope, they could walk in to turn the valves on those wells in IA. Lol
18/01/2021, 14:40 - melchi 🤔: E get how the communication be
18/01/2021, 14:40 - Lulu: Good point
18/01/2021, 14:42 - Lulu: As is the buzz sentence now from all the leaders “worry about only what you can control” in essence, this is non of my business 😁
18/01/2021, 14:42 - melchi 🤔: This just means They'll be like a service company to Heirs Holding and Co
18/01/2021, 14:42 - melchi 🤔: A new 'Organisation' will be created to hold this people, while they operate the field
18/01/2021, 14:43 - melchi 🤔: I hear the name of the organisation was mentioned in the meeting sef, as forgotten
18/01/2021, 14:43 - Alfred: Okay
18/01/2021, 14:46 - Alfred: This is what I got from someone who attended. 




The affected facilities are the Agbada & Obigbo facilities - wells, flow lines, manifolds, field offices, flow stations and gas plants (including Nkali Flow station)
We continue to operate these facilities through the transition period so things stay the same - plans and targets inclusive. WRFM/STOG programs and associated costs are being reviewed with the new owners on the way forward.

Personnel currently working in these facilities can apply for other roles come March in line with Reshape schedule.

Personnel will not be transferred directly to the new owners. Instead, for those who will leave (there will be people impact), there will be severance of their Shell contracts with pay offs as applicable. They may then choose to apply to the new owners on their own terms.
18/01/2021, 14:50 - melchi 🤔: This could be sweet
18/01/2021, 14:59 - melchi 🤔: If you get a double deal
18/01/2021, 14:59 - melchi 🤔: Significant Package  + New Appointment
18/01/2021, 14:59 - melchi 🤔: Could as well swing the other way
18/01/2021, 15:04 - Alfred: Yea I guess. I’m quite concerned about the office guys that do the studies and data stuff. If they’d all be able to transfer, up to team leads etc.
18/01/2021, 15:06 - melchi 🤔: Well, there are fewer open slots for ppl to compete for. So its a pretty tough climb. Some friends are affected. Tough man
18/01/2021, 18:30 - melchi 🤔: If you interested in spooky stuff. Do this one on Netflix, ESPECIALLY THE 6TH Episode.

22/01/2021, 17:40 - melchi 🤔: Sorry
22/01/2021, 18:04 - Alfred: I watched this. Funny one of the books they referred to In Episode 1 I actually almost read when I was much younger.  Mum saw me reading it when I was like 12 pages in and seized it. Lol. Never saw it again. Same with one famous monk Lobsang Rampa. He had many books. I think Dad bought them when he was seeking answers to the universe. Mum hid them from us but I still found one of the monk’s books. Interesting perspectives.
22/01/2021, 18:11 - melchi 🤔: Hmm, you keep finding
22/01/2021, 18:11 - melchi 🤔: The Reincarnation episode. 👀
22/01/2021, 18:32 - Alfred: Yea saw that too. The monk said he reincarnated too. His main body was getting too old. Lol. 

Why I can understand all these angles is because I’m not looking for answers.

29/01/2021, 07:52 - Alfred: Yea happened yesterday. And some might experience it today. Seeing one evision screen? Restart your computer. Then if you press the start/windows button, press it and press r. Look for a program called run. Open it. Type gpupdate in it and enter. It will update some group policy. Takes like 10mins or more. Restart your computer.
29/01/2021, 07:53 - toba@SHELL: Thanks

29/01/2021, 08:38 - Alfred: 😂😂😂😂
29/01/2021, 13:50 - toba@SHELL: So, guys in PH pls be careful this period. Taskforce guys and other criminals are roaming around. I had an experience last week friday. 2 guys in mufti and 1 guy in army uniform on bike blocked me and extorted 50k from me.
29/01/2021, 14:03 - tobi@SHELL: From you toba....
29/01/2021, 14:07 - Lulu: 😳😳😳 you’re joking. 50k that what happened
29/01/2021, 14:11 - tobi@SHELL: Really what happened?
29/01/2021, 14:17 - Shell.judith: Oooh wow, sorry Toba
29/01/2021, 14:47 - SHELL@yusuf: Incomplete LFI, one can still fall victim as we don't know what transpired and what to learn from it going forward. We should all be careful sha as always
29/01/2021, 14:53 - toba@SHELL: So, it happened around 7.30pm near Bori camp along airforce- rumuola road. A guy in mufti directing traffic  stopped me. Before i knew it 2 guys came from nowhere and accused me of violating traffic which i did not. There was a guy in army uniform on bike too. The guys ordered me out of the car, later entered the car with me while the guy in camouflage followed behind. They asked me to drive and threatened me, they will have me beaten up blah blah...unless i did a transfer of 50k to them
29/01/2021, 14:56 - toba@SHELL: lesson learnt: i am not gonna stop for anyone directing traffic in mufti at night. i will treat all GSAs as criminals especially if they are with guys in mufti
29/01/2021, 14:57 - toba@SHELL: So, what prompted me sharing this stuff was the SCIN message on security shared on the yammer page....exactly what happened to me
29/01/2021, 15:00 - Shell.judith: I had this same experience at same time. They threatened to jump into the car. I cannot quite remember how I got out if their grips. 

Do take care, Toba. Life is hard already and is harder with these issues.
29/01/2021, 15:01 - Lulu: Heya sorry Toba, horrible people
29/01/2021, 15:01 - Shell.judith: Especially the one that want to jump into the vehicles.
29/01/2021, 15:01 - Shell.judith: Couks even turn out to be kidnappers
29/01/2021, 15:10 - tobi@SHELL: Pele... thank God u had 50k to transfer... they no dey catch person twice
29/01/2021, 15:16 - melchi 🤔: Hmmm
29/01/2021, 15:18 - melchi 🤔: My younger brother was waylaid in lagos yesterday. Extorted 150k from him. Took his wristwatch,  atm, phone
29/01/2021, 15:18 - melchi 🤔: They had pos on them sef
29/01/2021, 15:19 - toba@SHELL: Wow...dts serious
29/01/2021, 15:21 - Alfred: so sad to hear Toba. thank God it wasnt worse.
29/01/2021, 15:22 - Alfred: The transfer can be flagged too. you can report the transaction officially and it will cause a pain for the account holder. other ways to track the holder and frustrate them but sometimes you let it go because ti takes some effort
29/01/2021, 15:22 - Alfred: men Gabby POS?? na wa ooo
29/01/2021, 15:25 - Shell.judith: Lagos situation is worrisome. Robberies at junctions with guns and matchetes. Attributed to fallout of hoodlums attacking police stations. 
May we be kept safe.
29/01/2021, 15:27 - SHELL@yusuf: So my driver had similar experience while running errand, after discussion with the millary guys, I found out that at Bori camp, the entrance to the barracks is right at the traffic light, so if you stop at the right-most of the traffic you ll be obstructing the road leading to the entrance of the barracks which does not need traffic light to be green to enter.
29/01/2021, 15:28 - SHELL@yusuf: Lesson is always avoid that lane at the Bori camp
29/01/2021, 15:34 - Shell.judith: I see. But I still think that there are no such signs. Of course, common sense maybe. But exploitation has been included in this.
29/01/2021, 15:34 - Shell.judith: Indeed..
29/01/2021, 21:35 - Lulu: <Media omitted>

29/01/2021, 21:40 - Lulu: They’d send you a mail asking that you pick up the folder from their office or opt for delivery
29/01/2021, 21:41 - Lulu: I didn’t even read that part, thanks to Toba who buzzed me earlier today if not I’d have no folder
29/01/2021, 21:42 - mayowa1@SHELL: Ok, I'll take note of the email

09/02/2021, 15:08 - toba@SHELL: GM looking like this?? He waxed his hair and beard sef...chuka what do you ppl even do there???
09/02/2021, 15:09 - tobi@SHELL: Loooool
10/02/2021, 07:11 - Shell@chuka: <Media omitted>
10/02/2021, 07:12 - Shell@chuka: E don dey happen 🤦🏽
10/02/2021, 08:10 - melchi 🤔: Yea, Yusuf posted this yesterday. I hear the Shell Reshape webpage has some suggestions on the skillset of the future workplace 😬.
10/02/2021, 08:23 - Shell@chuka: Just seeing Yusuf’s post 🤦🏽
10/02/2021, 08:25 - melchi 🤔: Lol
10/02/2021, 09:54 - melchi 🤔: So you see that complex Digi Ecosystem... when fully executed,  you would only need a handful of staff in the office (who can work remotely), and then have Contract staff or contractors execute operations.
10/02/2021, 09:54 - melchi 🤔: That's the Franchise model
10/02/2021, 09:57 - Shell@chuka: What will you do with this 'quit notice'?
10/02/2021, 09:58 - melchi 🤔: Quit i guess, landlord wants to use the house
10/02/2021, 10:08 - Lulu: 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 our new reality, we have no choice but to adapt to it or exit 😁
10/02/2021, 10:09 - Shell@chuka: Or become the property caretaker 😂
10/02/2021, 10:10 - Lulu: Even property caretaker can be at risk
10/02/2021, 10:11 - Shell@chuka: Have you seen Obigas Farm?
10/02/2021, 10:12 - Shell@chuka: So i recently did a review of an operator that significantly out performs Shell in Norway, I'll share some insights here for operations minded people
10/02/2021, 10:13 - Shell@chuka: Contracting: 
•	Backup tools built into contracts such that they don’t pay standby charges for back up tools 
•	Most services (e.g. Mud, BHA, Bit etc) are charged by the meter (depth) and as such there is an incentive to deliver more wells and not necessarily spend more days on location 

Operational optimization includes:
•	Since 2012, Equinor has leaned heavily towards standardized equipment, procedures and performance metrics. This has significantly reduced well planning time and overall operational cost 
•	Concept of ‘Perfect Well’, operations are broken down into the basic tasks and the performance record from the best performing unit on that task becomes to record to achieve or beat. It’s not really about driving technical limits but about achieving/repeating/beating a performance record that has already been set
•	Racking of sand-screens in less severe weather operations
•	Vessel based well head retrieval as opposed to using the rigs 
•	Use of high performance dual derrick rigs especially for exploration wells 
•	Limit wireline scope, especially with exploration wells, Most logs are acquired with LWD. **Also reduced coring activities
•	Reduce/eliminate wireline logs, carrying out most logs while drilling.
•	Logging of cement barriers only if the cement job doesn’t go well or if there is a double barrier function 
•	Global approach to reducing technical sidetracks; trick is to go from being heavily overbalanced to riding the margin, it’s a lot easier to respond to pressure gains than to cure losses

Technology:
•	Use of wired drill pipes to improve hole cleaning while reduce circulation time by measuring ECD along the entire string
10/02/2021, 10:14 - Lulu: No I haven’t, I hear he’s doi very well
10/02/2021, 10:17 - Kosi: <Media omitted>
10/02/2021, 10:23 - toba@SHELL: Gabby and yusuf...see some of the exact points we discussed some weeks ago
10/02/2021, 10:24 - toba@SHELL: Our contracting strategy does not encourage performance.. some of it is ridiculously foolish...e.g. completions eqpt without back-up
10/02/2021, 10:26 - SHELL@yusuf: Good insight, I have experience with 23 contracts and counting to deliver a well. The rig contract is key to driving cost, next re drilling fluid, DD/FEWD and Tubular.
10/02/2021, 10:28 - SHELL@yusuf: Our FEWD rates are not competitive in my opinion, you have footage and a circulating rate with covers every other time you re downhole but not drilling. In a rig with significant npt this just blows the DD/FEWD cosy
10/02/2021, 10:31 - SHELL@yusuf: Now we have loads of revised contract but several equipment are not included in them. We tried to get an RTTS packer unsuccessful, had to reachout to a former contractor begain outside exist contract, this begs the question then why was the contract reviewed.
10/02/2021, 10:34 - SHELL@yusuf: Currently no bit maker has a contract for bit, all the vendors re pass throughs. Now they have discovered the current rate can't buy the bit from the maker and accommodate their markup. Seeing the one off PO is now  forbidden u go back to the vendor and buy mill tooth for the cost of TCI.
10/02/2021, 10:35 - SHELL@yusuf: I feel globalisation has made learning easier but we still need to fine tune our local practice to enjoy the benefits of these best practices.
10/02/2021, 10:35 - Lulu: Obviously our major problem is Contracting and using horrible rigs (the likes of BR-301)
10/02/2021, 10:35 - toba@SHELL: This thing pisses me off...we keep deceiving ourselves...then gabby will come with PIPs...🤨🤨
10/02/2021, 10:39 - melchi 🤔: Lol. Maybe Franchise will solve all the problems 🙊
10/02/2021, 10:47 - bennie@SHELL: No be if your TDS fit deliver one hole section? Or your mud pump fit give you 1,200gpm? or your washpipe no dey spoil everytime? Or you no fit align your rig well so you use chain tong to run all your connections to the end before you torque up all the connections of your chrome tubing to 11,000ft?
10/02/2021, 10:48 - bennie@SHELL: Is there even food first self
10/02/2021, 10:50 - bennie@SHELL: This one is just very funny, you guys are the real Heroes Yusuf na who no go no know wetin DE dey see. Bit contract with contract holders that cannot deliver bits. FEWD vendor will tell you ho ha that he cannot deliver at contract rates.
10/02/2021, 10:50 - melchi 🤔: 😂😂😂
10/02/2021, 10:51 - toba@SHELL: I hear on one rig, no coral barge, so they were using edm waste basket to take waste mud😂😂😂...all bcoz somewhere someone said reduce coral barge and 'save' money
10/02/2021, 10:51 - bennie@SHELL: You get set up right from the rig! he say na wired drill pipe.
10/02/2021, 10:51 - SHELL@yusuf: I didnt want to talk about these, food is an issue, u need to get a contract to pay community @ 22% MU, then pay the contractor with 4% MU thru rig contract
10/02/2021, 10:51 - bennie@SHELL: Availability seems to overshadow quality. Rice Rice Rice Rice
10/02/2021, 10:52 - SHELL@majek: I was going to but I don't know where to start from.
10/02/2021, 10:52 - SHELL@yusuf: You do same for waste management handled by community. then they go dont you know your work? Hmm with a full team of waste magt and ER, this is my job too
10/02/2021, 10:52 - SHELL@majek: To talk*
10/02/2021, 10:52 - bennie@SHELL: Let me stop.
10/02/2021, 10:53 - SHELL@majek: Yusuf they said an engineer is a project manager and should be able to handle his space I.e do everybody's work. They said we like to complain. So we are looking at them now.
10/02/2021, 10:54 - SHELL@yusuf: i mobilise coral barge, finance and logistic ll say u use too many coral barges go with this one and come for more, then we have need for extra and it take 10days to source for it. we start to use waste skip to drill top hole then HSSE folks grill us on risk assessment and care for environment
10/02/2021, 10:54 - Lulu: Mehnnn this is crazy, and these issues have been there since we joined sef
10/02/2021, 10:54 - SHELL@majek: But Major, any one that can get our leaders to focus on the real issues, has done well.
10/02/2021, 10:55 - SHELL@yusuf: AY i tire but sometimes, it gets too much for us.
10/02/2021, 10:55 - toba@SHELL: In Shell UK, the DE doesn't even bother about SAP and logistics...just focus on technical...
10/02/2021, 10:55 - Lulu: You guys in ops are the real MVPs, honestly
10/02/2021, 10:57 - toba@SHELL: If they say, feel free to talk..na scam..i don't think we will have BIC drilling wells again
10/02/2021, 11:01 - SHELL@yusuf: We can but probably with some changes, the same rig did it with different rules. Since rules have changed certain things in our ops has to change
10/02/2021, 11:01 - SHELL@majek: Yusuf I made a mistake. When I got back from S&E, I went to tell my people that we should adopt the AMIT structure. Where you have a team that manages all this stuff for us. My brother, they told me it is like I am struggling with workload. I should go and grow capacity and reconnect with the spirit of the well engineer. Imagine that?
10/02/2021, 11:02 - toba@SHELL: 😆😆😆
10/02/2021, 11:02 - SHELL@yusuf: so i looked at 21yrs space - BR301 delivery in dodo North 3&4 are the best times in SPDC in the last 21yrs
10/02/2021, 11:03 - SHELL@yusuf: Exactly the problem, it mental. Once we break from the mental phase we set sail
10/02/2021, 11:03 - SHELL@majek: You will be giving feedback. They will shut you down in the meeting. Then when no one talks, they will say that silence means consent. And when you start talking they will call you and tell you to learn tact.
10/02/2021, 11:03 - SHELL@yusuf: For swamp only
10/02/2021, 11:04 - SHELL@majek: There are serious issues in this business. Yet we want to be chasing smoke screens. Lets continue na. We can all be mad together
10/02/2021, 11:07 - SHELL@yusuf: Mark told the LT in a retreat that young engrs usually attend to witness back then. Guys i think the engineers are bugged with too much distraction lets try to free them off it and demand delivery in technical.
10/02/2021, 11:07 - SHELL@yusuf: Same meeting SPDC manager goes - we re looking at how to give 1DE two rig to handle.
10/02/2021, 11:07 - Lulu: 🤣🤣🤣🙈 you’re joking
10/02/2021, 11:08 - SHELL@yusuf: Clearly i knew our mentality was the issue because a manager saying this does not see anytin wrong yet but Mark already saw it and was trying to change it
10/02/2021, 11:10 - SHELL@majek: I am not joking o
10/02/2021, 11:10 - Lulu: So Gabby’s solution seems to be the best in the long run, quit notice 🙈🏃‍♀️
10/02/2021, 11:10 - SHELL@majek: Yusuf I now see my HODs behaving the same way. Anyway, lets be all mad together
10/02/2021, 11:12 - Lulu: Sorry guys, I feel for you. More confirmation that I need to run from ops 🙈 I’ve taken it off my IDP
10/02/2021, 11:13 - SHELL@yusuf: I think this is the beginning of the end. Shell is taking a hard look at the onshore business that ll mean sometin in the near future. Sabotage, oilspill court cases is beginning to mean alot to them now than ever over 21bln in losses
10/02/2021, 11:13 - Lulu: True
10/02/2021, 11:19 - melchi 🤔: <Media omitted>
10/02/2021, 11:40 - melchi 🤔: Have you heard of Capex Reshape. Lol
10/02/2021, 11:41 - melchi 🤔: savings targeted from operations over the next 2 years
10/02/2021, 11:41 - melchi 🤔: 😁
10/02/2021, 11:42 - melchi 🤔: $41M from Npt reduction 😂😂
10/02/2021, 11:42 - melchi 🤔: BR 301, we'll soon come knocking on your door
10/02/2021, 12:21 - SHELL@yusuf: we have no doors, come in no need to knock
10/02/2021, 12:31 - Alfred: lol. wahala be like bicycle

13/02/2021, 09:32 - toba@SHELL: More people are complaining in my estate about the increased amount spent on electricity bills, and this isn't tied to increased tariff
13/02/2021, 10:07 - toba@SHELL: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-56041189
13/02/2021, 10:09 - SHELL@yusuf: If you feel something is not right you can complain for PHED to check you system out
13/02/2021, 11:51 - Shell.judith: And to see if there are illegal connections to your line or someone manipulated your meter to read really fast (I know they bypass a meter, but I do not know if they make a meter read faster artificially, might be possible like in filling stations)
15/02/2021, 15:13 - toba@SHELL: How come company has paid salary this early? Is it because there is no performance bonus?🤨🤨
15/02/2021, 15:55 - Lulu: Interesting, I wonder why
15/02/2021, 15:55 - Alfred: very weird
15/02/2021, 15:56 - Lulu: Yea
15/02/2021, 16:46 - tobi@SHELL: I never still see alert ooo
15/02/2021, 18:26 - melchi 🤔: Maybe it's tied to SVS deadline 🤔
16/02/2021, 14:14 - Lulu: Mehnn see how young this Upstream director looks. I wonder how old he is, already a director 😳😳😳
16/02/2021, 14:14 - Lulu: He sha looks like one Hollywood actor, trying to remember the guys name

16/02/2021, 14:54 - Lulu: Please translate
16/02/2021, 14:54 - Lola@shell: Will you help me bring the iron. But it was the play on words that cracked me up

17/02/2021, 09:07 - toba@SHELL: Nobody is asking the critical question 🙄
17/02/2021, 09:07 - Lulu: So the company is clear about the savings they make from the depreciation of the naira
17/02/2021, 09:07 - Lulu: Ask na 😝
17/02/2021, 09:08 - Lulu: Ehen, now you’re talking Toba

17/02/2021, 11:16 - toba@SHELL: Meanwhile they are collecting same dollars for salary from napims...and you spend less than 50% of that to pay salary...why not give us some percentage of that...even if it is one-off as allowance
17/02/2021, 11:17 - Alfred: i really have no words. they will say painful decision.

20/02/2021, 13:27 - Shell.judith: https://www.jobs.ac.uk/
20/02/2021, 13:27 - Shell.judith: Do the sites I provided above is for the Uk , there are some schools that sponsor your Masters or PhD degree. The only downside to that is that you will have to study what they are doing a research on .... not what you want . 
So just play around the site .

The sponsored one is called studentship .....
20/02/2021, 13:27 - Shell.judith: Secondly there is a place where you can also browse for jobs
20/02/2021, 13:27 - Shell.judith: https://www.jobs.ac.uk/search
20/02/2021, 13:27 - Shell.judith: Uk just started the points based visa Canada was using this 2021 which will favour a lot of us
20/02/2021, 13:27 - Shell.judith: The site above will show you the jobs that are eligible for a work visa and how to calculate the points
20/02/2021, 13:27 - Shell.judith: For the Uk , relocating thru Job is the best but you need to have the skills . The school is easy if you can show proof of funds . An advise if you are going thru school is : apply for your visa alone and once you get it apply for your spouse so that you won’t need you show so much proof of funds in your bank. 

Ask your friends and family to help . The money has to be in your account for just 30 days ....

Then if you are choosing a course , try and see if you could go for the ones for two years or more and that has job placements
20/02/2021, 13:27 - Shell.judith: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/skilled-worker-visa-eligible-occupations/skilled-worker-visa-eligible-occupations-and-codes
20/02/2021, 13:27 - Shell.judith: This is a job engine . Take time to prepare your cv to Uk standard, upload your cv here and you will get ads that relate to your job profile ... Like loads of them
20/02/2021, 13:27 - Shell.judith: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/skilled-worker-visa-going-rates-for-eligible-occupations
20/02/2021, 13:27 - Shell.judith: https://www.totaljobs.com/
20/02/2021, 13:27 - Shell.judith: https://www.monster.co.uk/
20/02/2021, 13:27 - Shell.judith: https://uk.indeed.com/
20/02/2021, 13:27 - Shell.judith: https://www.reed.co.uk/
20/02/2021, 13:27 - Shell.judith: https://www.jobsite.co.uk/
20/02/2021, 13:27 - Shell.judith: So this is a list of the companies that can actually sponsor your visa .... because not every company does . When you see a job you wish to pursue just check the list above and check if they sponsor visa
20/02/2021, 13:27 - Shell.judith: That’s my bit ... sorry it’s coming late , was choked yday . Will drop any other relevant info I have 


One advise for Uk 

Look for a cheap and affordable school offering your course if you are the one paying .... Uk degree has the same standard everywhere . Leave London for now . It’s expensive both the schools and living expenses .... When you get to Uk , u can always go to London if you want ....

Good luck guys ...
Gracias 🙏🙏🙏

24/02/2021, 09:03 - Shell@chuka: Obiga just used style to say don’t look for progression
24/02/2021, 09:04 - SHELL@yusuf: Pls anyone not impacted here shud proceed to get GM approval now to apply. I see no reason why folks after us can apply and some of us are indirectly been positioned to remain as 5s
24/02/2021, 09:05 - Lulu: Yea, I concur, no dulling 😁
24/02/2021, 09:06 - SHELL@yusuf: I dont understand - progression is less likely for 3yrs and younger is this wells specific?
24/02/2021, 09:06 - SHELL@yusuf: Because I hear some young folks like us already 3s else where
24/02/2021, 09:08 - tobi@SHELL: Clauses just fill everything obiga say
24/02/2021, 09:10 - Lulu: 3yrs and below on current SG
24/02/2021, 09:11 - Lulu: Not Wells specific
24/02/2021, 09:32 - melchi 🤔: Pls somebody should summarise this townhall. I no join 😐
24/02/2021, 09:41 - SHELL@yusuf: From where I joined in, fill ur profile details, target 3jobs in Wells and 2 slot outside noting ur competence and experience for them. Know ur job preference and rank them. Stay safe COVID-19 is real full stop
24/02/2021, 09:45 - toba@SHELL: They also said you should not apply if your role is not impacted unless you get Mgr and GM approval......that doesnt seem fair if you are due for a progression and your current role is not impacted
24/02/2021, 09:50 - melchi 🤔: OK.
24/02/2021, 09:51 - melchi 🤔: Issorait
24/02/2021, 09:51 - Lulu: Yea, not fair, I guess they’re trying to minimize the number of applications they have to deal with. It’s not Wells specific though

13/03/2021, 14:43 - melchi 🤔: Lool
13/03/2021, 16:14 - Lola@shell: Does this mean that the banks have been keeping the USSD charges to themselves?
13/03/2021, 16:15 - Lola@shell: Also don't the telecoms companies also charge customers for these services?
13/03/2021, 16:16 - Lola@shell: This is sad sha. USSD is soo convenient
13/03/2021, 16:25 - Alfred: My dear so many questions.
13/03/2021, 16:32 - buari@SHELL: I think it’s a shakedown. This issue has been ongoing for some time now. Banks and telcos are not aligned on what the charges should be
13/03/2021, 16:34 - buari@SHELL: Telcos want banks to pay. Banks want telcos to charge customers. I don’t think it’s a case of the banks blatantly refusing to pay for services rendered
13/03/2021, 16:41 - Lola@shell: Nigerian banks and greed 🙄
13/03/2021, 16:41 - Lola@shell: Like N25 for every ussd transaction isn't enough
13/03/2021, 16:53 - buari@SHELL: It’s all of them (telcos and banks) that are greedy. I’m guessing telcos underestimated the success of the ussd service and now want a share of the pie.

13/03/2021, 17:23 - Chinwe@SHELL: Guys, has any of u been in a situation where u forgot ur iPad passcode? I need ur advice abeg🙏🏼
13/03/2021, 17:26 - melchi 🤔: Yes.
13/03/2021, 17:26 - melchi 🤔: Your options may end in resetting the entire ipad
13/03/2021, 17:27 - melchi 🤔: I didn't have to do that, as I got a divine visitation and suddenly remembered the password after like 2 months of giving up
13/03/2021, 17:27 - Chinwe@SHELL: Aww....I'm not sure I ever deliberately did a backup

16/03/2021, 20:04 - buari@SHELL: Lol. It wasn’t a debt payment plan by the banks that has resulted in a stay of action by the telcos. It’s a new charge. Shakedown
16/03/2021, 20:05 - melchi 🤔: Shakedown bro, shakedown

17/03/2021, 16:50 - Alfred: Still happening. Like 10mins ago. Heard the shots.
17/03/2021, 16:51 - Alfred: Someone called me and I heard the shots on their end. They had to end the call to be sure they were safe.
17/03/2021, 16:52 - Shell.judith: That sounds like a grueling experience
17/03/2021, 16:53 - Lulu: Wow
17/03/2021, 17:00 - Alfred: they are very okay though, no issues at all. the community people firing at each other may not be though.
17/03/2021, 17:10 - toba@SHELL: They're fighting over land near golf estate
17/03/2021, 17:12 - Lulu: That’s how on Monday I was passing that Nwaja (the road that leads to nkpogu) see broken glass on the road, noticed a police vehicle that was probably just deployed there after whatever happened had happened. Some cars along the road were damaged (about 2)
17/03/2021, 17:13 - Lulu: Does anyone here still get updates via text from shell security? Cos I noticed I just stopped getting
17/03/2021, 17:16 - Shell.judith: <Media omitted>

17/03/2021, 17:20 - Lulu: Ok thanks Juju, I’d reach out to them
17/03/2021, 17:22 - Shell.judith: No wahala
17/03/2021, 19:05 - SHELL@majek: This one was these Wike's task force vs the nkpogu community. When I got there the police blockage was still in place along that stretch. After some seconds of waiting I saw the task force convoy. Must have been more than 10 pick up trucks coming out. Then a patrol van went ahead before we followed
17/03/2021, 19:08 - SHELL@majek: Heard this too. Gist is that those lands near Golf had been under litigation or something. I hear judgement was passed recently. But one of the parties had sold off most of the land already. Making it complicated to implement the ruling. Its Okuru vs Abuloma communities. Trying to verify this Intel though
17/03/2021, 19:20 - Lulu: Just imagine, I was quite scared while passing through
17/03/2021, 19:21 - Lulu: Heard so too
17/03/2021, 19:22 - SHELL@majek: Reminded me of riots that used to happen in the north back then. Our country sha. Sighs
17/03/2021, 20:05 - toba@SHELL: True...heard there was a meeting of chiefs and  one of them beat up the other persons...so reprisal attacks
17/03/2021, 20:30 - melchi 🤔: Hehe. I still have memories of my dad taking us to school then in Zaria. He always had this combat knife in the car
17/03/2021, 20:31 - melchi 🤔: And on some days, we were hidden in a local chieftain's house
17/03/2021, 20:31 - melchi 🤔: Man had plenty horses. 😊😊

18/03/2021, 20:14 - melchi 🤔: https://www.shell.com/media/news-and-media-releases/2020/shell-finalizes-sale-of-martinez-refinery.html
18/03/2021, 20:15 - melchi 🤔: This divestment aligns with Shell’s strategy to reshape refining efforts towards a smaller, smarter refining portfolio focused on further integration with Shell Trading hubs, Chemicals, and Marketing.

By 2025 we expect to have interests in a smaller, core set of refineries. A key advantage of these core sites will come from further integration with Shell trading hubs, and from producing more chemicals and other products resilient in a lower-carbon future, such as bitumen and base oils. Our focus is value rather than volume. We will invest in our core refineries to enable them to deliver resilient returns.
18/03/2021, 20:16 - melchi 🤔: Reshape started since sha
18/03/2021, 20:16 - melchi 🤔: I thought it was an afterthought following Covid and LOP

Planned strategy all along?

07/04/2021, 09:59 - melchi 🤔: Wanna know if they're having challenges in their supply of fertilisers at the moment. Orders placed but supply delayed.
07/04/2021, 10:05 - Alfred: hmm. offline

08/04/2021, 01:33 - Shell@chuka: I generally swear by Samsung products... but quick poll, LG or Samsung refrigerator?
08/04/2021, 06:15 - Lulu: If it was AC I’d have said Samsung, I’ve not used a Samsung fridge but just bought one cos I believe Samsung products are more durable (judging from my experience with LG ACs in comparison to Samsung ACs)
08/04/2021, 06:28 - tobi@SHELL: For AC the king is Panasonic
08/04/2021, 06:40 - Lulu: Mehnn Panasonic AC cost na die, Buhari has told me that I kent try it😁 plus they’re not friendly with low current
08/04/2021, 07:07 - toba@SHELL: Yeah they are very sensitive to low current
08/04/2021, 07:09 - toba@SHELL: I would go with LG fridge...used Samsung fridge but the design was faulty and couldn't be easily fixed when it had fault...although i expect them to have changed it sha...but i have been using LG fridge and it is good
08/04/2021, 07:19 - Chinwe@SHELL: LG for me, although I haven't tried Samsung fridge. My current LG fridge is about 10yrs and hasn't disappointed yet, even with the ever fluctuating/unstable PH and GE power.
08/04/2021, 07:26 - Lulu: True, I have an LG fridge, that LTI-free gift, been using it since then (should be about 4yrs now) no issues
08/04/2021, 07:26 - Lulu: I sha switched to Samsung cos my LG ACs are annoying me
08/04/2021, 08:47 - SHELL@yusuf: Thermocool is baba, I have used mine since 2014 not a single issue. Like my mum ll say when it comes to cooling appliances go for thermocool. Before they didn't have fancy designs but they now have some.
08/04/2021, 08:48 - melchi 🤔: Yusuf, we are missing you at the office. Fara can't explain much of the SSAGS2 WEIS funnel
08/04/2021, 08:50 - SHELL@yusuf: Barth/Yemi has the answers
08/04/2021, 08:50 - Lulu: Aaahhh I can attest to this, there was one I used that was handed over to me by my sister who got it as her wedding gift in 2006, used it till 2013, I used it from 2013 till 2016 when I sadly handed it over to my cab guy Sunny 😁 no issues whatsoever
08/04/2021, 10:49 - Lulu: I just got IT info from a credible IT source
08/04/2021, 10:49 - Lulu: Use of external hard drives and USBs would soon be prohibited.
08/04/2021, 10:49 - Lulu: I wont tell you what you are expected to do.
08/04/2021, 13:03 - Shell@chuka: Thanks guys
08/04/2021, 13:03 - Shell@chuka: I’ll check thermocool out
08/04/2021, 14:07 - melchi 🤔: Thanks Lulu.
08/04/2021, 14:08 - melchi 🤔: So even the bitlocker option on USBs will stop?
08/04/2021, 14:13 - Lulu: Heard so, I just forwarded as heard
08/04/2021, 14:13 - melchi 🤔: Okay
08/04/2021, 14:50 - Alfred: Tightening up against information leaks I guess
08/04/2021, 15:03 - Lulu: Exactly
08/04/2021, 16:17 - Lulu: Please who has resolved an issue with excel where your right click function doesn’t function
08/04/2021, 16:17 - Lulu: If so please share how you resolved it cos I’m tired of wasting my time with IT 😭

08/04/2021, 16:35 - Lola@shell: Wow. This is quite unrealistic. How are we expected to share info with contractors on the rig
08/04/2021, 16:35 - Lola@shell: Some of these files are too large for emails
08/04/2021, 16:37 - Lulu: Yea, it would be hard sha, would make our lives more difficult. Let’s hope there’s an alternative
08/04/2021, 16:51 - Kosi: Share file function
08/04/2021, 17:00 - tobi@SHELL: Total is giving their staff the opportunity to buy dollars and pounds at CBN rate regardless of reason! $60K per year I think 

Any hope for us !
08/04/2021, 17:05 - Lulu: Via Teams?
08/04/2021, 17:06 - melchi 🤔: Lol

08/04/2021, 17:19 - Lulu: And Laughing at all the Menti questions related to this 😡
08/04/2021, 17:23 - melchi 🤔: Lol
08/04/2021, 17:25 - melchi 🤔: SCRUM team put a similar idea on the table about 2 years ago. Dayo was given action to push at SCiN LT level. Nothing was ever heard since thay day
08/04/2021, 17:28 - Shell@chuka: I remember this very clearly
08/04/2021, 17:29 - tobi@SHELL: I feel its even beyond SCIN... word on the street is that the sell of shell gas that pays our salaries in nairia.. fx only enters nigeria only during major projects
08/04/2021, 17:30 - Shell@chuka: Take it again
08/04/2021, 17:30 - toba@SHELL: Pls repeat
08/04/2021, 17:31 - tobi@SHELL: Cos even management will benefit from this cbn rate for us
08/04/2021, 17:33 - Lulu: RT, Tobs retype it please. I’m confused
08/04/2021, 17:34 - tobi@SHELL: Wats take it???

08/04/2021, 17:35 - tobi@SHELL: It's clear nahhh....
08/04/2021, 17:36 - tobi@SHELL: ***sale
08/04/2021, 17:37 - melchi 🤔: I understood this move. Could have come from one silly drive for cost savings in the past sef. Stuff was not always this bad
08/04/2021, 17:37 - Lulu: So in essence, profit from SNG is what pays our salaries?
08/04/2021, 17:38 - tobi@SHELL: Most likely... the centre hijacks our fx.. our management does not even have a say
08/04/2021, 17:39 - tobi@SHELL: After remitting govt share
08/04/2021, 17:39 - Lulu: I suspected they didn’t from their body language while responding to those Menti questions at the SCiN town halls
08/04/2021, 17:42 - melchi 🤔: On paper though, as per annual OP Plan, your salaries have a naira dollar split
08/04/2021, 17:43 - melchi 🤔: We can just follow the plan 🤷🏽‍♂️
08/04/2021, 17:44 - bennie@SHELL: Do they? Didn't think so
08/04/2021, 17:44 - tobi@SHELL: Seriously????
08/04/2021, 17:44 - Lulu: 😳😳 for real?
08/04/2021, 17:44 - bennie@SHELL: HR sub committee in Nigeria will not agree to that
08/04/2021, 17:44 - bennie@SHELL: Shell just follows suit
08/04/2021, 17:45 - bennie@SHELL: They even try to make other things to not have dollar split. Like Catering and all that
08/04/2021, 17:45 - melchi 🤔: I'm talking the salaries in your Well Budget. Abi, that's for Wells n
08/04/2021, 17:45 - Lulu: I think that’s for consultants
08/04/2021, 17:45 - bennie@SHELL: Errrr this one is what made Bulus vex. Wells staff are paid from JV
08/04/2021, 17:45 - bennie@SHELL: We will claim that in The capex
08/04/2021, 17:46 - bennie@SHELL: Then go to Base JV and collect in Naira

08/04/2021, 17:47 - bennie@SHELL: It's not that straightforward
08/04/2021, 17:47 - bennie@SHELL: Na Base JV dey pay our salary
08/04/2021, 17:47 - Lulu: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
08/04/2021, 17:49 - melchi 🤔: Follow the plan that's my own. Finance will advice staff salary for use in Cost estimates. Why do this and execute otherwise
08/04/2021, 17:49 - bennie@SHELL: Lmao as Alhaji if he trusts Finance. Laugh at you in Group Charge 🤣
08/04/2021, 17:50 - melchi 🤔: I'm already prepping my slide pack to justify not wasting time updating the CET for OP21. Useless work

10/04/2021, 09:00 - melchi 🤔: Estimate like 70k
10/04/2021, 09:00 - melchi 🤔: 50k minimum

10/04/2021, 09:56 - SHELL@yusuf: The cost depends on the model, spring is the most expensive although from experience i ll advise u avoid it as it is not for all weight class
10/04/2021, 09:57 - SHELL@yusuf: Supreme is the best, good firmness with the right softness for all weight class
10/04/2021, 09:57 - Lulu: Thanks Yusuf, that’s the only place I knew of, I bought my spring bed from there, no issues
10/04/2021, 09:58 - Lulu: Weight class do you mean very heavy people?
10/04/2021, 09:58 - Lulu: I’d try this one, I don’t think I need spring for my daughter
10/04/2021, 09:58 - SHELL@yusuf: I think from 60kg u can't buy models like grand or galaxy
10/04/2021, 09:59 - SHELL@yusuf: Yes this is ok

12/04/2021, 09:34 - toba@SHELL: SECURITY ADVISORY: KIDNAPPING IN PHC -Keeping with the trend of the last few weeks, we have yet again recorded an increase in kidnapping while in transit within Port Harcourt City and suburbs. Victims are usually profiled and trailed along some major roads and when leaving popular recreational areas and shopping centers .Areas of concern due to activities of kidnappers include Stadium Road, Rumuomasi Market Junction, Aba Road from Pleasure Park, Okporo Road and Peter Odili Road. Others include ALCON-Woji-Golf Estate flyover and Elekahia-Rumuomasi link road. The likelihood of such kidnaps increases during the hours of darkness and on weekends and public holidays. It is therefore vital to remain vigilant and maintain situational awareness at all times. All are once again reminded on the directive to leave the office premises before 18H30 and advised to avoid night movements every day including weekends.
12/04/2021, 09:34 - toba@SHELL: Guys be careful especially on that woji link bridge...stuff happened there last week

LT: "Let's work on your recommendations"
27/04/2021, 11:56 - Alfred: They say if you take up some of these outside tasks like spe, stock exchange, mentor ship etc and you take honorarium then you are creating conflict

27/04/2021, 12:12 - bennie@SHELL: I remember this one, that's when I resigned officially from defending anything. It was very bad. I remember your pressure for days. Sweating under AC. Praying that Jude will not say highlight all those cells let me see the sum

27/04/2021, 12:42 - Lulu: That they have already done some selections, but the newly appointed JG1s and 2s would now have the opportunity to be part of the selection process
27/04/2021, 12:43 - Alfred: In the words of Osagie, you must have been confused to think the company wanted you to lie on its behalf 😂😂😂

28/04/2021, 08:43 - SHELL@yusuf: If you must get your children Android Portable Devices, you need to follow the below steps to be safe:

1. Register a gmail account for them with the correct age and with your email as the parent.
2. Install Google Family Link on your own phone.
3. Add their registered e-mail to your Google Family Link.
4. Factory Reset their android device if they already have one then login the device with their own gmail account that is linked to your Google Family Link. 
5. If it is new device, make sure it is their gmail you use to activate the device.
6. Immediately you carry out step 4 & 5 above, your phone will get a notification to allow them activate the device, this is the beginning of you taking control from anywhere. 
7. All adult content of any form will never load in their phone.
8. They cannot install anything without your approval remotely from the Family Link.
9. You can lock their device from anywhere.
10. You can set a start and stop time for their device usage, the phone will lock when it gets to that time even if you forget.
11. YouTube will not allow them see adult content too.
12. There is also YKids, which is YouTube for Kids, I recommend you remove the normal YouTube and give them YKids.
13. From your Google Family Link, you can see how long they stayed on each app or page to warn them where necessary. 
14. You will see as much as major details of the app.


A very good measure to help u and your kids frim stories that touch.
28/04/2021, 08:44 - Alfred: 👍🏼👍🏼

28/04/2021, 09:17 - Lulu: Abeg what was Gabby’s recommendation

28/04/2021, 17:24 - melchi 🤔: I can easily pick that up. The Kidnapper being Tiv, the negotiator being Idoma
28/04/2021, 17:24 - melchi 🤔: Feels like a staged record though.
28/04/2021, 17:24 - melchi 🤔: May be wrong sha. But stick sickening nonetheless
28/04/2021, 17:28 - Alfred: saw many comments below the post agreeing with this. some also say the tiv guy sounded like a police officer. well, even if it is simulated, these kind of calls (the real ones) are happening way too often in ng
28/04/2021, 18:04 - SHELL@yusuf: Around 70person murder in Benue community in gross inhumane ways. Nothing is impossible right now, as sad as it sounds.
29/04/2021, 07:35 - toba@SHELL: Despite SPDC’s efforts to reduce the spills, more than 100 were recorded last year. The risk of environmental damage and crime weigh heavily. So with the Nigerian government, we’re now reviewing options for our onshore oil portfolio in the country. But I also want to make clear that as a company, we remain committed to operating in Nigeria. Its deep waters represent one of Upstream’s core positions. We have a successful LNG business. And as we move forward, it’s in these areas where we intend to focus our investment in the country
29/04/2021, 07:36 - toba@SHELL: From Buerden's speech....
29/04/2021, 07:36 - Alfred: 😓😓😓😓
29/04/2021, 08:33 - SHELL@yusuf: Coupled with the 3 court cases lost in Q1 paving way for affected parties to sue RDS for SPDC ops, this decision will be taken seriously now as it affects RDS like never before.

29/04/2021, 16:19 - toba@SHELL: STATE BROADCAST BY HIS EXCELLENCY NYESOM EZENWO WIKE, CON, GSSRS, POS ON THE RECENT SECURITY BREACHES IN RIVERS STATE. 

My dear people of Rivers State On 28th April 2021, the Rivers State Security Council, in consideration of the recent murderous attacks on security personnel in Ikwerre and Abua/Odual Local Government Areas imposed a night-time curfew on our land borders with other States. 

2. A review of the present security situation shows that the threat of further deadly attacks on hard and soft targets across the State still exists. 

3. This being so, it has become imperative for the State Government to take further necessary measures to secure our State and safeguard lives and property. 

4. Accordingly, the State Security Council has, today, after exhaustive deliberation, decided and advised that a statewide curfew on human and vehicular movements be imposed as part of additional measures to prevent the faceless criminals from unleashing their
deadly actions. 

5. Consequently, a night curfew is hereby imposed on the entire 23 Local Government Areas of the State prohibiting any human and or vehicular movement within or any part of the State from 10.00 p.m. to 6.00 a.m. from today 29th April 2021 until further notice. 

6. We wish to repeat that in taking these and other drastic measures at this time, our singular intention is to secure our State and guarantee the protection of lives and property. 

7. While therefore calling for continued understanding, we again advise everyone to be vigilant and promptly report every suspicious movement in your neighbourhood to the security agencies for
immediate actions. 

Thank you and may God bless Rivers State.

06/05/2021, 15:55 - Shell.judith: Possibly that the person can be trusted to deliver without supervision
06/05/2021, 15:55 - Shell.judith: Skilled in delivery
06/05/2021, 15:57 - tobi@SHELL: My sister.... E shock me ooo
06/05/2021, 15:57 - Shell.judith: Perhaps.
06/05/2021, 15:58 - Shell.judith: But a contract position should have more remuneration. But I was shocked to see one a day asking for accountant with ICAN with 15yrs experience and about 45yrs and to pay 240k

07/05/2021, 10:27 - Lulu: Has anyone here had issues with the normal Vitafoam mattress
07/05/2021, 10:28 - Lulu: Cos the cheapness compared to the other two is speaking to me😁
07/05/2021, 10:28 - Lulu: I have the spring, so I know that is good. I’ve never used the semi orthopedics so don’t know if it’s necessary 😁
07/05/2021, 10:29 - Lulu: ie does it dent after a while?
07/05/2021, 10:31 - Shell@chuka: Lmao, in the words of a great man, ‘sometimes, it is more expensive to be cheap’
07/05/2021, 10:32 - Lulu: Yea, I need a great man/woman to counter this wise statement, from their experience with this mattresses 😁
07/05/2021, 10:53 - SHELL@yusuf: Lulu stay away from semi bla bla bla. I have used orthopedic spring firm and I tell you its waste of money
07/05/2021, 10:54 - Lulu: 💃💃💃 thanks Alhaji, ahead ahead with the one already speaking to me😁🙈
07/05/2021, 10:54 - SHELL@yusuf: Supreme is fair enough, my next stop is orthopedic with topper I am tired of all the weak mattress
07/05/2021, 10:55 - toba@SHELL: Buy Mouka foams...😉
07/05/2021, 10:55 - Lulu: Orthopedic is sooo hard, I’ve slept on one before, the worst nights of my life, couldn’t sleep well
07/05/2021, 10:56 - SHELL@yusuf: I guess u read my comment thru your price lens, stay away from spring, I don't know wat is normal mormalone sha
07/05/2021, 10:56 - SHELL@yusuf: With a topper is better, last "forever"
07/05/2021, 10:57 - Lulu: God forbid, the very first mattress I bought as an adult (when I moved out to stay on my on in this ph) was Mount, as you sit down, it takes the shape of your behind even after you’ve stood up. So just rest assured that that area you’d lie on would be dented in no time
07/05/2021, 10:57 - toba@SHELL: 😂😂😂
07/05/2021, 10:57 - SHELL@yusuf: Ibadan advice - ignore
07/05/2021, 10:58 - Lulu: Funny enough it’s a spring I currently use, bought it 5yrs ago, and it’s still excellent
07/05/2021, 10:58 - Lulu: Don’t know what a topper is sha
07/05/2021, 10:59 - Lulu: Anyway I’m getting the mattress for a room that would seldom be used, so I guess normal mattress should do😁
07/05/2021, 10:59 - Lulu: *mouka
07/05/2021, 11:00 - SHELL@yusuf: Its like a duvet which is worn on the mattress to provide some softness - expensive sha. I guess I like hard mattres because my wife says it OK everytime I complain
07/05/2021, 11:00 - Shell@chuka: There’s memory foam (more expensive) and fiber topper, they are also quite expensive........ in Lagos
07/05/2021, 11:01 - Lulu: Ok

Only God delivered her...at this colworth hospital in peter odili....just be careful with all these private hospitals
08/05/2021, 12:39 - Lola@shell: Wow
08/05/2021, 12:39 - Lola@shell: Is it deliberate or are they really this clueless?
08/05/2021, 12:43 - toba@SHELL: It was deliberate; because they wanted to use up the banned drug. Worst aspect was the banned drug should have been given via the muscles, but they injected into the blood. The hospital denied doing all these, but the doctor later came to us to confess because she said her conscience was troubling her. The owner threatened and warned the doctor not to say anything
08/05/2021, 12:44 - Lola@shell: I remember when you told me this story. I didn't know it was your sister. We thank God for healing

10/05/2021, 14:11 - Lulu: STATE BROADCAST BY 
HIS EXCELLENCY NYESOM EZENWO WIKE, CON, GSSRS, POS ON THE RECENT SECURITY BREACHES IN RIVERS STATE 

My dear people of Rivers State

These are extraordinary times for our country and our State. Last week Friday, we witnessed yet another multiple armed ambush on police checkpoints along the East-West road which resulted in the cold-blooded murder of 7 police officers.

2.	We again express our condolence to the families of the dead officers and the State’s Police Command for this irreparable loss and pray for the peaceful repose of their innocent souls.

3.	We have reviewed the way and manner the recent attacks were executed and discovered that the perpetrators, who disguised themselves as security officers, moved in unhindered from Oyigbo to launch the attack.

4.	The nation’s security agencies are on their trail and we are confident that they will all be arrested soon and brought to justice. 

5.	We wish to assure every resident that we are not intimidated by the sporadic and cowardly attacks on predetermined security targets by faceless criminals on our soil; neither will we be cowed into succumbing to a baseless and doomed secessionists agenda. 

7.	However, as a further step towards enhancing our collective safety we have reviewed the existing night time curfew across the 23 Local Government Areas, which will now start from 7 p.m. and end at 6 a.m. until further notice from tomorrow 11th May 2021.

8.	The security agencies are hereby directed to note the new curfew time, ensure strict compliance and effectively deal with any person or group that violates or attempts to violate it.

9.	We have reviewed, and for the moment, declined the pressure on the State Government to activate our youth to defend the State from these terrorists because we don’t want to complicate our very delicate security situation by creating opportunities for some other monsters to emerge.

10.	However, we are determined to deploy everything at our disposal to advance the safety and security of lives and property in our State and nothing will stop us from defeating the evil forces presently threatening our individual and collective security.

11.	We continue to appeal to members of the public to understand with us in the midst of the economic troubles that our actions may inflict as our one and only aim is to achieve and sustain the maximum security of lives and property in our dear State. 

12.	We further appeal to the public to understand that security is everybody’s business and play their own roles, especially in passing intelligence information to the law enforcement agencies to process and take pre-emptive measures to counter and advance our collective security. 

13.	Once again, thank you for your cooperation as we continue to work with the nation’s security agencies to keep us safe and secure.

14.	Thank you and may God bless Rivers State.
10/05/2021, 14:14 - toba@SHELL: What do you guys think, those of us dropping children at schools in GRA. It will be good to review our routes.( maybe avoid police stations😕)...or no issues?

15/05/2021, 19:29 - toba@SHELL: STATE BROADCAST BY HIS EXCELLENCY NYESOM EZENWO WIKE, CON, GSSRS, POS ON THE RECENT SECURITY BREACHES IN RIVERS STATE 

My dear people of Rivers State

We wish to again thank you all for your kind support for all the measures we have undertaken so far to check the recent intermittent breaks to our security by the predetermined attacks on security checkpoints and the resultant killing of some security personnel on our own soil.

2. We wish to further appreciate and commend you for your steadfastness in the midst of the socio-economic discomforts, dislocations and troubles caused by the proactive actions we have been constrained to enforce in response to the reprehensible assaults on our collective peace and security by the faceless terrorists.

3. Thank heavens, all those responsible for the premeditated and brutal ambushes and murders of security personnel in the State have been apprehended and are now facing the bitter venom of our laws as none that is proven to be criminally liable will escape the fury and crushing impact of justice. 

4. We wish to reassure every citizen and resident that we are able, willing and ready to act directly and decisively, and at any time, with the full weight of our government to forestall every security threat to our State from  any person, group or quarters. 
 
5. For now, after yet another review of the prevailing security situation and in particular, the effect of the curfew on our citizens, the State Security Council has decided to relax the curfew time a little for Obio/Akpor and Port Harcourt Local Government Areas only.

6. Consequently, the current night time curfew in Port Harcourt and Obio/Akpor Local Government Areas will now be effective from 8.30 p.m. to 6.00 a.m. from Sunday 16th May 2021, while the prevailing starting to closing time-frame of 7.00 p.m. to 6.00 a.m. still continues to apply to the curfew in the rest of the 21 Local Government Areas of the State until further notice.

7. The nation’s security agencies are on ground to strictly enforce the State-wide curfew as reviewed and arrest and prosecute any intransigent person or group that may fail to comply.

8. Our State; our heritage is no one else’s property to assault and destroy at will. It goes without saying therefore, that every citizen and resident bears some level of responsibility to protect it from the injurious hegemonic tendencies of strangers and ensure the peace, safety and security of everyone. 

9. Let me therefore appeal, once again, to every one of us not to hesitate to pass on every valuable nugget of information relating to the evil conclaves, plots and potential assaults and breaches to our security by evil-minded Nigerians and their collaborators, to the attention of the law enforcement agencies for appropriate counter actions.

10. We can assure you that with such vital and credible intelligence gathering and information sharing with the Government and the security agencies we have the capacity, will and the strength to overwhelm and completely rout these faceless terrorists and neutralize their threats to our God-given natural rights to live in peace and go about with our daily lives without any cause to fear about our safety and security in any part of our own land.

11. Once again, thank you all for your support and understanding as we continue to work day and night with every fiber of our being to protect our State keep everyone of us safe and secure.

12. Thank you and may God bless Rivers State.

27/05/2021, 19:55 - Shell.judith: And assuming that they cleared the snow when driving out
27/05/2021, 19:56 - Shell.judith: I can assume that only Rick went out
27/05/2021, 19:56 - Shell.judith: If he drove to carry out the theft
27/05/2021, 19:57 - Lulu: It’s only Rick that seems to have significant snow all over
27/05/2021, 19:57 - Shell.judith: The driveways all looked unclear.

27/05/2021, 19:59 - Shell.judith: Unless this snow fell when he arrived
27/05/2021, 20:00 - Shell.judith: The assumption is that he drove and not walked and that he cleared the car before leaving
27/05/2021, 20:00 - melchi 🤔: He got snow under his car
27/05/2021, 20:00 - Alfred: Okay ricks car also has more snow under it. Which means it was away from that place when the snow started

After being taken to an Airforce hospital, and the bullets removed... He has been flown to Lagos 🤦🏽‍♂️, the same flight ticket she didn't wanna buy, she finally bought it... SMH

09/06/2021, 22:07 - Alfred: it is a devised system actually. people reported the tweet. technically yes they have the right to take down tweets as they like. but this authority is packaged with a system... and that system is trying to be seen as fair. if tweets are reported harmful, they will take it down. you agree to that when you created a twitter account.
09/06/2021, 22:07 - Alfred: whoever doesnt like it should send the message via NTA.
09/06/2021, 22:08 - melchi 🤔: That word 'fair'...you looking for trouble
09/06/2021, 22:09 - melchi 🤔: That word 'harmful'... you looking for trouble
09/06/2021, 22:09 - melchi 🤔: Remember, D&I
09/06/2021, 22:09 - melchi 🤔: 👀
09/06/2021, 22:12 - melchi 🤔: There's a theory that goes something like 'for a community to grow or evolve or something like that, ALL voices must be heard and the Townhall, and let the listeners have the right to CHOOSE what to keep, and what to discard, but NO voice should be silenced". 

In short, that our assignment was to take a position on the above statement and submit an argument for it
09/06/2021, 22:13 - melchi 🤔: ***heard at the Townhall (Global Social Media)
09/06/2021, 22:14 - Alfred: Oh. Yea. I totally get your concern on what is deemed fair and harmful. Ethical dilemmas. And the way tweeter has chosen to deal with it is by screening what “other people” have reported.
09/06/2021, 22:15 - melchi 🤔: You sure?
09/06/2021, 22:16 - Alfred: Now, about hearing the community....  remember when before you heard anything it came from punch or vanguard. And everyone who had a public voice was an educated author or broadcaster...  
now whoever gathers a million followers can spread more news than punch. Is it good ? Who knows. It definitely has its bad side.
09/06/2021, 22:16 - Alfred: Yup. I report tweets from time to time
09/06/2021, 22:16 - melchi 🤔: And if more ppl than others say 'we are fine with the post, we like it'. Will Twitter go with popular vote, or they will be judge and jury to break the stalemate
09/06/2021, 22:17 - melchi 🤔: 😥😥
09/06/2021, 22:18 - Alfred: As far as I know, if it is not reported, it doesn’t get touched.
09/06/2021, 22:19 - melchi 🤔: Aaah! That means the Aye's having been winning the poll
09/06/2021, 22:20 - Alfred: I think Facebook is worse. Remember when people started committing suicide on fbook live? 
These platforms have also had those waves of ethical dilemmas. That wasn’t what the platform was built for but that’s what people are doing.... and they had to act. 
If I recall, Facebook doesn’t even wait for reported posts. They scrub the timeline very often.
09/06/2021, 22:21 - melchi 🤔: Dilemma plenty ooo
09/06/2021, 22:21 - melchi 🤔: Even regulators in the US are struggling to keep up
09/06/2021, 22:21 - Alfred: It is not the ayes winning. You are seeing it the wrong way. People don’t vote for a post to stay. They report it if they “think” it is offensive by that individual’s own standards. Then Twitter investigates and can take it down. There is a difference.
09/06/2021, 22:22 - Alfred: I agree with you on this man. O kpo o kpo o kpo kpo kpo
10/06/2021, 08:14 - Alfred: can you hold a company that produces oil liable for the emissions of the users (consumers) of hydrocarbon products? i.e  emissions that individuals generate driving, flying, heating their homes etc using hyrdorcarbon products and gas?

e plenty.
10/06/2021, 08:16 - Alfred: can you hold cocacola and mentos responsible for injuries people have sustained mixing coke and mentos? or when people abused codeine (a drug).... how culpable is the pharmaceutical manufacturer?
10/06/2021, 08:21 - Alfred: my take is society continues to evolve as we find balances when new trends, secondary effects, unforeseen circumstances are introduced. i also see a trend of 'sensitivities' and 'cancel culture' - 'no one can sit on the fence kind of thing - which may not be sustainable. but how we go do? i have some ideas, but i will be cancelled too lol.
10/06/2021, 09:52 - melchi 🤔: Most def..., I will be the first to cancel you sef, even if just for fun 👀
10/06/2021, 10:18 - Shell.judith: Yes, it is one if the levels of carbon emission mitigation☺️
10/06/2021, 10:46 - Alfred: when i look at the UN SDGs on poverty and human conditions  (lifting millions of people out of poverty etc etc)... i see more emissions on the horizon.
10/06/2021, 10:52 - Shell.judith: Well, I agree. But the dilemma is lifting them out of poverty (giving them access to more energy) without increasing emissions. The stewardship of emission is from cradle to grave
10/06/2021, 10:56 - Alfred: yup. that is the dilemma. but the  most noise heard is the case of the oil industries. 
again have you seen the stats from the fishing industry?
10/06/2021, 11:14 - Shell.judith: I agree. But there is energy politics.
10/06/2021, 11:15 - Shell.judith: Sometimes, people try to downplay what they dont have to have negotiation power
10/06/2021, 11:16 - Shell.judith: Narratives are carefully put out
10/06/2021, 11:17 - Shell.judith: Nobody will do shakara with oil again
10/06/2021, 11:17 - Shell.judith: In fact, most people rather say they work for an energy company.
10/06/2021, 11:18 - Shell.judith: So, if the society does not fully accept crude as major source of energy, companies are in innovating to throw other sources into the mix
10/06/2021, 11:18 - Shell.judith: That is the key to their continued survival
10/06/2021, 12:08 - Alfred: true. politics is always involved. we were talking jack ma just yesterday. oh, and there was a time this oil was the cause of many wars, bribes and regime overthrows... the big oil companies, backed by the same governments were used to penetrate and destabilize countries... for oil.
Focus on the politics, the answers will be there
10/06/2021, 13:54 - melchi 🤔: Ukraine's Euro 2020 football kit provokes outrage in Russia

Ukraine's shirt is emblazoned with its borders including Russian-annexed Crimea

A new kit for Ukraine's football team, showing a map including Russian-annexed Crimea, has provoked anger in Moscow.

Ukraine unveiled its shirt for Euro 2020, emblazoned with its borders including Crimea and the slogan "Glory to Ukraine!"

Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine in 2014, and considers it a part of its territory, something rejected internationally.

A Russian MP called it a "political provocation".

In a statement to the BBC, European football's governing body Uefa said: "The shirt of the Ukrainian national team (and of all other teams) for Uefa Euro 2020 has been approved by Uefa, in accordance with the applicable equipment regulations."

The head of the Ukrainian football association, Andriy Pavelko, revealed the kit in a video on his Facebook page on Sunday, days before the European Championship kicks off.

The front of the yellow shirt shows the contours of Ukraine in white, including Crimea and the pro-Russian separatist-controlled regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.
10/06/2021, 13:55 - toba@SHELL: I hope ukraine will play against Russia😁😁

10/06/2021, 14:09 - Shell@chuka: Thanks
10/06/2021, 18:45 - melchi 🤔: Herein our hope lies, that Shell and  its friends will have sense later when the price is $200/bbl. Mr. Bala Wunti knows something we don't 👀


"The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) yesterday predicted that oil price could climb as high as $200 per barrel, as banks and major International Oil Companies (IOCs) withdraw from funding critical projects in the industry, leading to supply shortage and a huge upsurge in the amount the commodity is sold."

18/06/2021, 22:03 - toba@SHELL: ```Unless you understand your role in society, you can never make any meaningful contribution.

According to the Greeks there are three types of people on earth:
- the idiots, 
- the tribesmen, and 
- the citizens. 
 
Studies show only 10% of Africans are citizens. 
The remaining 90% are either tribesmen or idiots. 

2. When the Greeks used the word "idiot", they did not use it as a curse word. 
Idiots are people who just don’t care. 
If they write exams, they will cheat.
If they are in government they will steal.
An idiot does not care at all, if he eats bananas he throws the peels anywhere instead of putting them in a trash bin. 

According to the Greeks, some societies have more idiots than tribesmen and citizens. 

3. The next set of people are "tribesmen", these are people that look at everything from the point of view of their tribe.

These are people that believe in you only if you are part of their tribe. 
It can be terrible to have a tribesman as a leader, he will alienate the rest.

When the Greeks talk about tribes, it’s not just about ethnicity, they also consider religion as a tribe.
A great percentage of Africans are tribesmen, because they view everything from the point of view of their tribes.
They trust only their tribesmen. 

4. The last group are "citizens". 
These are people that like to do things the right way. 
They will respect traffic light rules, even if no one is watching them.
They drive within speed limits.
They respect the laws, won’t cheat in exams.
In government they won’t steal.
They are compassionate and give to others to promote their wellbeing. 

Citizens often promote projects that benefit everyone. 
The Greeks called this group the citizens. 

Some countries have more citizens than tribesmen and idiots. 
Others have so many idiots. 

A tribesman can become a citizen through orientation.
And an idiot can become a citizen by training and constant enforcement of the law. 

But things fall apart if you elect an idiot or tribesman to lead you if he has not been reformed. 

*Where do you belong?*
*Are you an idiot, a tribesman or a citizen?*

Reflect about your life.
Reflect about your country and Africa in general before you answer.

Food for thought.```

19/06/2021, 19:34 - SHELL@yusuf: Notice on Tarrif Review

The Federal government will review tariff from July next month. 

They claim they have been subsidizing at N26/Kwa

They have reduced the subsidy to N13/ Kwa 

They are planing to remove it completely to zero. If this happens, Tarriffs will increase by 75%

We need to buy a lot of Units now

This increase is with all the attendant inefficiencies


Toba don't come and be complaining in July ooo, do the needful.

22/06/2021, 17:59 - Shell.judith: Just wondering if it is a typically experience in the field
22/06/2021, 17:59 - Shell.judith: Say when we are increasing WOB
22/06/2021, 18:00 - Shell.judith: I mean, it is not a  downhole drilling
22/06/2021, 18:00 - toba@SHELL: Yes, it can be formation induced..hard streaks

23/06/2021, 09:01 - SHELL@yusuf: I think in terms of standardising design, that will help. Contracting has senior stakeholders like NAPIMS and NCDMB, we will have to do as much as they agree with us on
23/06/2021, 09:03 - SHELL@yusuf: Standarding ll also help material management, year in year out Ops teams are looking for materials which should have been finalised in frontend before these project come to execute phase
23/06/2021, 09:03 - melchi 🤔: Toba, see the slide
23/06/2021, 09:03 - toba@SHELL: Definitely,  we also need to step up with planning or else things like LLIs/ LLMs will slip since that will be managed centrally
23/06/2021, 09:03 - melchi 🤔: It shows critical success factors. I think that's the targeted benefit

25/06/2021, 14:09 - melchi 🤔: Abi it is actually responding to market forces
25/06/2021, 14:09 - SHELL@majek: coz their preference had been to export or flare it
25/06/2021, 14:09 - melchi 🤔: Low supply?
25/06/2021, 14:10 - SHELL@majek: I don't have more details sha. But DOMGAS works with a price template. Just like PMS
25/06/2021, 14:10 - melchi 🤔: Infrastructure yea
25/06/2021, 14:10 - melchi 🤔: It's more trouble to 'sell' I guess
25/06/2021, 14:12 - melchi 🤔: I'm looking for a Shell answer sha
25/06/2021, 14:12 - toba@SHELL: No infrastructure, no pipelines...even the guys buying from us are owing massively..but the AKK pipeline might help things in the future if it is ever completed😕
25/06/2021, 14:13 - melchi 🤔: Is this really the reason for the price difference. Or it is regulation
25/06/2021, 14:22 - melchi 🤔: Okay. Got some info on DOMGAS prices being regulated by government. Plenty issues with DOMGAS actually. Availability being a big one.

28/06/2021, 09:47 - Lulu: 🤣🤣🤣
28/06/2021, 09:48 - Lulu: I wish I could delete WhatsApp from their phones
28/06/2021, 09:48 - tobi@SHELL: My dear it keeps them busy oooo
28/06/2021, 09:48 - Lulu: Yea it actually does, busy consuming a mix of good and nonsense 🤣
28/06/2021, 09:50 - tobi@SHELL: The nonsense is way greater than the Good
28/06/2021, 09:54 - Lulu: My sister
28/06/2021, 10:02 - SHELL@yusuf: Lulu your mum has raised a valid concern, no one wants to be a walking inverter powering bulbs upandan. 😷
28/06/2021, 10:19 - Lulu: She should trust me who has taken the vaccine 😛 so I’m a walking inverter?🤣
28/06/2021, 18:10 - Shell@chuka: <Media omitted>
28/06/2021, 18:28 - melchi 🤔: Sounds tik tokish
28/06/2021, 20:15 - Lola@shell: Lool
28/06/2021, 21:14 - Lulu: 🤣🤣

29/06/2021, 15:50 - Lulu: Chaii🥰
29/06/2021, 15:52 - Lulu: See his background sef (for those confused, I’m referring to the ongoing townhall😁)
29/06/2021, 15:52 - Shell@chuka: Toba, see yo ur church members
29/06/2021, 15:53 - Lulu: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
29/06/2021, 17:01 - toba@SHELL: Carnal people everywhere 😕😕
29/06/2021, 17:02 - toba@SHELL: I might have to repackage myself too
30/06/2021, 08:46 - tobi@SHELL: Na wa ooooo
30/06/2021, 08:47 - Lulu: My sister
30/06/2021, 08:47 - tobi@SHELL: Did this attack happen this morning???
30/06/2021, 08:47 - Lulu: I think early hours of the morning
30/06/2021, 08:47 - Lulu: So so crazy
30/06/2021, 08:47 - toba@SHELL: Yeah...this morning
30/06/2021, 08:47 - Lulu: On a shell location
30/06/2021, 08:47 - tobi@SHELL: Very oooo
30/06/2021, 08:47 - toba@SHELL: Inside job
30/06/2021, 08:48 - Lulu: I guess someone had beef for the PUM
30/06/2021, 08:48 - tobi@SHELL: Obviously.. to even know his room.. they are a regular in the facility
30/06/2021, 08:48 - Lulu: Yea
30/06/2021, 08:49 - Alfred: Inside job for sure
30/06/2021, 08:49 - tobi@SHELL: But how did the GSA dey sleep wey pple enter facility
30/06/2021, 08:49 - Lulu: Mehnn someone cannot work or sleep with peace of mind again on all these remote locations
30/06/2021, 08:49 - Lulu: I think the GSAs are becoming useless
30/06/2021, 08:50 - Alfred: Terrible stuff.
30/06/2021, 08:50 - toba@SHELL: Those swamp locations are porous...truth be told...security can't fix all, you need to have good community liason...to be getting inside info
30/06/2021, 08:51 - SHELL@yusuf: From my experience then in Forcados FS, the community has access into the facility as cleaners and 1local surveillance
30/06/2021, 08:51 - toba@SHELL: Soku is the same.....
30/06/2021, 08:51 - SHELL@yusuf: GSA can't cover the full perimeter
30/06/2021, 08:52 - Lulu: Ok
30/06/2021, 08:52 - tobi@SHELL: Is the accommodation area not fenced... is a GSA not supposed to be walking around at night
30/06/2021, 08:53 - SHELL@yusuf: I suspect poor illumination, which helped them target a dark spot to bore the fence
30/06/2021, 08:54 - toba@SHELL: Fenced with wire stuff that can easily be cut...
30/06/2021, 08:54 - toba@SHELL: When we did OTC at Tunu FLB, same thing...find strange guys movingaround your rooms at night...many of them community workers
30/06/2021, 08:55 - Alfred: This community workers thing....
30/06/2021, 08:55 - tobi@SHELL: I no wan talk oooo....
30/06/2021, 08:56 - tobi@SHELL: Cos after what Ojor suffered in the hands of kidnappers... he collected severance ooo
30/06/2021, 08:57 - Lulu: Who’s Ojor
30/06/2021, 08:57 - tobi@SHELL: The guy that was kidnapped last on company business
30/06/2021, 08:57 - Lulu: Ok
30/06/2021, 08:59 - toba@SHELL: Same with Enwhe, these are not times to demonstrate positive bias...if stuff is not safe, shut down. Simple
30/06/2021, 09:03 - melchi 🤔: How can someone sleep peacefully after a shift. Its hard to imagine in these situations
30/06/2021, 09:03 - melchi 🤔: How can the mind rest.
30/06/2021, 09:03 - melchi 🤔: Like how,
30/06/2021, 09:05 - melchi 🤔: It's daring to go way into a Shell facility to kidnap someone
30/06/2021, 09:06 - melchi 🤔: Machetes and Pistol I here
30/06/2021, 09:06 - melchi 🤔: Meaning others with AKs and Machine Guns can be emboldened to do this on other facilities
30/06/2021, 09:07 - melchi 🤔: Well, not daring considering GSAs are useless
30/06/2021, 09:08 - SHELL@yusuf: Again the security of a facility partly driven by your production. I assume Gbaran is the most protected facility i know. I recall a flowstation in Forcados where I go to send morning report due to network issues, the PUM had stove in his room plus egg and food stuff under his bed. I struggled to believe he was a PUM at first, but later I guessed the lack of volumes from there may have put it in that state. That particular FS if community wany they will just hire bus come and pack all without stress
30/06/2021, 09:09 - Alfred: Sigh 😔
30/06/2021, 09:10 - melchi 🤔: It's back to the money 💰.  That's valued over that guys life
30/06/2021, 09:10 - tobi@SHELL: Escravos ba???
30/06/2021, 09:10 - SHELL@yusuf: Sorry Escravos, you sabi
30/06/2021, 09:12 - Lulu: 🙈🙈🙈
30/06/2021, 09:19 - toba@SHELL: 😂😂...there is no shell facility in escravos...
30/06/2021, 09:21 - toba@SHELL: Besides, if i remember well, SOKU FLB is separate from the gas plant...same location but distinct facilities, not like gabran cpf
30/06/2021, 09:29 - bennie@SHELL: Continue to deliver? 👨🏿‍🦯👨🏿‍🦯👨🏿‍🦯 Sigh
30/06/2021, 09:30 - SHELL@yusuf: I pray this can be resolved passing a strong message this can only be one-off. If not with numerous locations in the swamp and limited GSA facility staff will become the victims on a continuous basis.
30/06/2021, 09:32 - Lulu: Spot on
30/06/2021, 09:50 - Alfred: Define a strong message.
30/06/2021, 11:11 - SHELL@yusuf: I recall a close in festac then growing up, thieves usually come to Rob them, then a Naval Officer packed into one of the houses there. One evening the thieves came as usual but this time the naval guards from the man's house were on ground, the way they finished these robbers within minutes of the operation. Unfortunately young me saw the horrific dead bodies. That was the last they robbed that close I can remember.
30/06/2021, 11:13 - Lulu: 🤣🤣🤣 I like this your illustration of “strong message” don’t mind Alfy for making you relive this horrific experience
30/06/2021, 11:45 - Alfred: Lol. Sorry Yusuf. I remember Festac and it’s history. 
That is my point exactly. Shell and it’s GSAs can never ever pass a strong message. Not with investors in the “developed” world. 

We will have to wait for heirs holdings. Or ateke oil and gas production Nigeria Ltd.
30/06/2021, 11:45 - melchi 🤔: And this same Alfred made a presentation on D&I advocating against such microbehaviours... I suspected he didn't even believe in what he was presenting
30/06/2021, 11:45 - melchi 🤔: 🤨
30/06/2021, 11:46 - Alfred: Lol. I Dey find money bros. But naija no be country. Not anymore. Sad though.
30/06/2021, 11:47 - Shell@chuka: I remember when we casually drove to Obudu and then to Uyo for Lulus wedding… no escort
30/06/2021, 11:48 - Alfred: !! Miles and miles of road and it was just our two cars. Enjoying the terrain and country side. 

Now the kidnapping franchise is rampant. Like mmm. It has become so profitable.
30/06/2021, 11:50 - Alfred: One thing though is that it is not necessarily true that if you do same now you will have an issue. But the question is do you have the mind to try it??? Knowing that if something happens you have yourself to blame and your folks will be like “but didn’t you know”?
30/06/2021, 11:50 - Alfred: Madam Lizzy sef will be like ah bros on top all the update I Dey give you still waka this waka. 😂😂😂 lol. Na wa sha
30/06/2021, 11:50 - Lulu: 🤣🤣🤣🤣
30/06/2021, 11:51 - Lulu: Even to go to my village here in Abia, dey fear me small. In December, I flew from lag to Owerri and from owerri back to lag, then lag to ph 🙈
30/06/2021, 11:52 - Lulu: But people are still moving on these roads, unfortunately when it’s the source of your bread you have no choice
30/06/2021, 11:53 - Alfred: 😂😂😂 climate change is looking at you 
But you must have heard madam Lizzys voice when booking your flight. You listened well.
30/06/2021, 11:53 - Alfred: True
30/06/2021, 11:53 - Lulu: 🤣🤣🤣
30/06/2021, 16:04 - toba@SHELL: @2348061229882 i heard you won the nature challenge. Congrats 👍..come and do giveaway for us...maybe 1 solar inverter😉😉...
